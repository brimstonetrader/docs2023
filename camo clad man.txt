"do you want new wave or do you want the truth"

camo-clad man with a gun in his hand
he kills little children, and salts foreign lands
he fucks little children, his eyes look like scars
takes fathers from homes and then kills them in wars

he's gauntly disheveled, the man is betrayed
the chemical bath is a stone ugly grave
his face full of wrath, the stepson's a lathe
with red Irish skin and a potion of age

a dead Irish dog and a burden to bear
his mother is cold, and silently there
his sisters are missing, escaped in the past
the victims of rape by a man with a vast

network of like-minded bourgeosie elites
who meet up in public at casual meets
and pass around children like bones at a pyre
they work for you and are easily fired


at with a rifle glock shotgun or uzi
stabbed with an arrow or tossed in jacuzzi
set to a thousand with hyper amperes
need to get rid of these fucking vampyres

a CIA man is a parasite worm
a pusher of poppies who never will turn
a next-level cop, he's too clever to catch
he's got a basement and ironclad latch

spawn of Wayne Gacy, good friends with the Carters
he shapeshifts and sits with a table of martyrs
who think he's a hero, his nose Welsh and eerie
the soldiers are happy and harbor no theory

they say that he glowed from uranium ore
and Jim Jones would have to be dead at his core
when thrown in the pulpit a devil well can
camo-clad man with a gun in his hand
