Our mission as participants in the charrette is to listen, affirm, and offer thoughtful ideas about the project as currently conceived and as it might evolve. Remember, this is not a workshop, where we home in on particular wording or details. The charrette is intended to vet overall design consideration, offering a macro rather than micro focus. To each presenter and copying Hope, by the next class meeting, write a memo with bullet-point notes on the following:

· Strong points of this project

· Potential hazards or difficulties

· Alternative ways in which this material might be treated

· Which, in your opinion, will make a stronger project, the primary idea or the alternate idea? Why?

Add complete sentences answering the following questions:

· Who is the witness? What is their voice and their unique perspective? Is there a distinct stance (warning, prophecy, exposition, exhortation)?

· Is the piece likely to provoke a particular reaction / expected action / response on the part of readers?

Title each response as follows: “Your first name_Response to presenter’s first name.” For example, “Arielle_Response to Caleb.” Turn in each response by emailing it to the presenter and copying Hope.

DOM CHAR RESP

- Your primary idea seems very solid, built on a foundation lending itself to both didactic accuracy and artistic license, with plenty of room for experimentation. It sounds like you've got a broad appreciation for your father and his childhood best friend as individuals, and I hope you glean some insight.

- The difficulties with family-related poetry, visual art, or film are different than what I'm used to. You'll have to parse a lot of granular stuff about your emotional and literal reality, which'll probably be tough. It will also probably be difficult to capture the feeling of early '80s Louisiana through text. I look forward to hearing what comes.

- You seem confident that poetry is the form for this project, and as such I don't think you should bother considering prose or non-fiction or anything like that. I do wonder about how you could treat the point of view here - temporal distance [say, you or your mother as the literal narrator] could give a warm fuzz, kind of lo-fi energy. Idk though!

- I think both could be really strong. I f heavy with comparative mythology and history and stuff, and think a intensively culturally relative exploration of the discovery of colors via poetry would be really gas. At the same time, a story about something in your own life is special, because you're the only one really primed to tell it. 

- The witness of the primary idea could be you, or your father, or someone else. I think you could make the themes from class resonate by taking this in many different directions. 

- I'm hoping this evokes empty, tragic nostalgia. Like pessimistic joy. If you choose the colors one instead I'd hope for oxymoronic placid-yet-explosive joy-of-creation, like Stop Making Sense the concert film or Duck Amuck.

ANDREA CHAR RESP

- You've demonstrated a solid commitment to telling a story that's vivid and true to yourself, in a framework that builds a feeling of alienation and nostalgia. I'm intrigued by how you will play with morality in the face of inequality.

- Flash fiction is simple to execute, but it can be difficult to communicate a wider thesis, especially when focusing on objects. It seems like it will be difficult to write emotionally while maintaining the structure that you've set for yourself, to my untrained eye.

- I wasn't sure from your presentation whether the individual stories will be vignettes, mostly unrelated, or a direct narrative. I think there are plenty of spots within that gradient that could be interesting, such as setting the story within a fantasy of the protagonist, or in flashbacks from the present.

- The second idea intrigues me somewhat more. I'm very used to having stray litter become a part of the scenery over the years when in nature, and think this could make great fodder for a group of stories like this, from a didactic or imaginative standpoint. I think both of your ideas could be really great.

- The witness appears to be you; on either project, you'll be drawing from personal experience, and literally witnessing the objects at hand.

- You said that this story is "pre-divorce", happier, in spite of the somewhat glum way you're framing it. Thus, I'm expecting a bit of optimism peppered in with stark realism. I'm excited to see what you make of the objects you write about. I apologize for being flippant with the word "American" in class - I meant it purely as a synonym for "someone with vapid consumerist values" in that context, which didn't seem to describe your main character well. Good luck with it! 



COLIN CHAR RESP

- Both of your ideas involve topics that you have a thorough emotional and practical understanding of, and I'm confident that either will result in a very compelling piece. I might lean more towards your former idea, as the story of the American jailer and jailed is very tragic, and very simple.

- Regardless of whether you're pulling from your politics research or testimony of people close to you, it will be hard to feel like you're fully characterizing everyone who you need to in the time you have, as both rely on complex social dynamics. 

- The structure of your prison idea was interesting. The situation eschews poetry by design, but you plan to mine the minutae for poetic imagery. I hope that your research gives you insight into this complex emotiona reality.

- I'd probably prefer to read your first idea, but I think either could be really engaging.

- The second idea is witnessing the modern prison-industrial complex, and the first the modern American end-state of a culture that has always commodified killers. Both will vary in point of view, but bear witness to these broad realities.

- Either could do really devastating things to my sense of empathy. I expect to be messed up.

SAMANTHA CHAR RESP

- Both of your ideas sound very important to you, and like they will be rife with insight. I am particularly interested in your first idea, and how you will portray the shadow over your town's collective memory.

- A possible hurdle with your second idea could be the bargaining stage. I don't really know what that would look like in this context.

- The first was a poetry collection, which will fit the subject matter well, and the next 5-7 micro-essays (idk if you're using DABDA). I have no qualms.

- I would prefer to read your first idea, but writing about trauma can be difficult, and both of your ideas are doable.

- This poetry collection will mostly host you and your family's witness to Katrina. Your secondary idea bears your own witness, to a souring relationship.

- Either of these will likely be explicitly sad in subject matter, but with the possibility for an uplifting conclusion. 

HANNAH CHAR RESP

- The elegies of a miner will draw closer and closer to him, revealing his character in a spirally, muddled fashion. He'll die in the end, a victim of deindustrialization and structural postmodernity. Even though I'm gay I really like Johnny Cash so I think this story will be in Sicko Mode.

- It might be hard to convolute this dude's life, making him secretive, adulterous, and generally mysterious. I'm excited to see how you bake that into his personality throughout.

- Your first idea seems settled so I'll focus on it. The series of elegies getting more and more proximate to our central, tragic mensch at the forefront? Great idea, stellar. Ending with the workboots, starting with the coworker, this story could be as complex as you wanted it.

- Fleeting thoughts could be nice I'm by no means anti-fleeting thoughts but I think you've got some gas with your first idea and you should pick that one.

- We never get first person! Witness all the way down, coworker, brother, daughter, wife, mistress, boots. Easily the most thorough embrace of the concept of this class I saw in a charrette.

- I'm expecting that Brian Jonestown Massacre lugubrieity, a real slow burn that makes me want to sit in silence and call my granddad. You're gonna do great [woman scientist emoji] [woman scientist emoji].

GRACE CHAR RESP

- The witness of your first idea was you, to your Nana, and life around her in 2021. This will be a personal account, and I hope that you learn something about yourself or what happened from seeing it through.

- The second idea could have some trouble depending on what sources you use, as it's hard to get reliable information about what the military does.

- You said this'd be MAC NOLIA style, with the backwards timekeeping, but not entirely. It makes me really happy to see everyone using time as a variable in their stories: Vonnegut's ghost would grin. I believe both of your ideas were poetry, but I'm not totally sure on the first (sorry).

- I would prefer to read your first idea because I have some jumbled issues with the army. I'd respect it either way though.

- The first idea will likely make you think a lot about some painful memories, and regrets. I'm really sorry that all of that happened to you during Covid, when it was much harder to literally be around people, especially sick or immunocompromised people. I hope that you are able to wield some of your Nana's sensibility here, and continue to do so in the future.


CRAIG CHAR RESP

- I'm excited to read either of yours. It sounds like you've thoroughly considered your character's background, motivation, and the events that will unfold, which means you've got plenty of time to polish that into the work of witness, be it the dream poetry, or the former close friends trying to hold on to what remains of the love they have for each other.

- I think Coulter might have had a point on your first idea. Dreams are full of weird little moments and images that have little to no meaning: if they don't, it's hard but not impossible to present them as dreams. It might be hard to give his ambitions the respect they deserve without dampening the effect of the dreams as night-images. 

- The first idea seems a very natural fit for poetry: given that the essential idea is somewhat of a language trick ('dream' in two senses), it makes sense that you'd want to give yourself more room to play with words. 

- I'd be more inclined to read the second one. Booksmart (2019) used to be my favorite movie, and it sounds like you'd be doing a way more interesting job exploring how nostalgia and reality contradict each other. I'd also read and enjoy your first one, which is a meaty compliment because I do not really care for poetry.

- The first idea follows a young boy, who is witnessing tumult and crime in his environment. We'd be witnessing his growth from the natural instinct to dissociate from one's surroundings, in that context, to the recognition that the fulfillment of his ambitions [going beyond dreams] must come through a process of reassociation, through difficult mental and emotional labor. The second reminds me of this post-rock song about an airplane, "Concorde." The character we as readers will probably identify with, the miscreant-aligned one, is unambitious, living in the town he was born. He feels a visceral, familial urge to protect his friend who had such immense innate talent that he was able to transcend the barriers he couldn't. He wants his friend to maintain his basketball success, while simultaneously being aware that this success will necessarily separate the two of them further. He's already beginning to notice that their personalities are drifting. It's not "if you love something let it go," it's "because i love you i will push you away," which burns so much worse. Sorry that was way too long, honestly, you presented the top two ideas imo in terms of potential for emotional density. 

- One of the more important theoretical concepts to be invented in the past 100 years is the adolescent. The coming of age story has, in comparatively little time to the others, become an essential literary genre. Both of your ideas are really intelligent and original implementations of this framework, and I'd be really interested in either.
