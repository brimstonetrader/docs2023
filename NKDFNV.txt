THERE'S FOUR NARRATORS, DIFFERENTIATED BY FONT.

- WILL, IN 2026, COMING UNDONE. HE'S FTM AND KIND OF QUIET IN PUBLIC.

- SIMONE, IN 2045, ALOOF, DECLASSIFYING/"FLUFFING" THE DOCUMENT.

- IRWIN,  IN 2029, I'VE GOT PLANS FOR HOW THIS CHUCK MATTHEWS DUDE PLAYS IN AND I WANTED TO INTRODUCE HIM THROUGH YET ANOTHER RECURSIVE STRUCTURE, AN ANNOYING DEMSOC PODCAST. I'LL PROBABLY USE THIS STRUCTURE AGAIN FOR FURTHER DIDACTIC FAKE-HISTORICAL WORLD BUILDING, WHICH THERE WILL BE A LOT OF AS I CONTINUE THIS.

- THIS IS JUST MY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE I HAVEN'T WRITTEN FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YET, BUT I'LL BE USING THIS FONT FOR PSILO, THE "GOOGLE" OF TEXT-GENERATING ADVANCED NEURAL NETWORKS IN 2045, RENDERING SIMONE'S VISION OF WHAT WOULD MAKE THE STORY "AFFIRMING AND NON-CONSEQUENTIAL," WHICH IS STRUCTURALLY QUITE FLIMSY AS IT'S BEING MADE UP BY AN AGENT USING AI, BUT LOCALLY INDISTINGUISHIBLE FROM WILL (IT'S SORT OF IMPLIED THAT THE AI IS REALLY PHENOMENAL BECAUSE THEY TRAINED IT ON TWO YEARS OF AUDIO INPUT FROM SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, ALONG WITH THE DATA THEY COLLECT IN WHAT YOU'VE READ, BUT THE FOR SURE COMES AT THE END, NESTED IN A CHECK CLEARANCE). OBV I WON'T BE USING CHATGPT TO WRITE ANYTHING, THAT WOULD BE EVIL. 

OVER THE SUMMER I'M JUST GONNA KEEP GOING. I'VE GOT A LOT OF SHREDS THAT I WANT TO FLESH OUT MORE.


WILL IS PLAINTEXT

SIMONE IS FOOTNOTES AND CHAPTER HEADINGS

PSITEXT LOOKS LIKE q[str]p AND IS A TINY BIT LIGHTER AND SMALLER.
