I first heard about UChicago reading about the Miller-Urey experiment. Despite my lack of post-secondary experience in the life sciences, I find the formation of complex structures from primordial ooze interesting, and respected UChicago for facilitating such a groundbreaking and controversial experiment. For undergrad, I considered your math program, checking online sources, and noted your reputation for rigor and direct application.

COVID-19 Personal Statement
This section of the application gives you an opportunity to describe how COVID-19 has impacted your educational experience in relation to your academic performance or grading scale. For example: “For the spring semester, my university let us take two classes P/NP and I chose this because..” or “For the spring quarter, my college graded all classes as P/NP and we didn’t have an option for a letter grade.”

This is an intense question and I will need to be uncharacteristically self-effacing and nihilistic to answer it properly. Covid certainly impacted my GPA. My college was online from March 2020 to May 2021. I lived in a small town in Arkansas, where I was totally unable to see any friends, because two grandparents lived with me. It was very difficult to find motivation to do my online coursework. I can honestly say that I continue honing skills built in previous classes after they were done. I took Linear Algebra entirely online, recieved a B, and ultimately felt fuzzy on whether I'd truly grasped the material. Since then, I've watched 3Blue1Brown's series many times, and frequently rotate in matrix computations in my Sunday Review Sessions. I think I am better at Linear Algebra now than I was at the end of that class. I like maintaining and steadily building on my existing skills. 

The thirteenth of March has become like a holiday to me and most of my friends. This was the day that Covid hit Arkansas, that the schools shut down. The email hit everyone's phones at once, 11:30 AM. I was in the cafeteria. Everybody started screaming. Some people Bart-Simpsonly began clapping in the first couple of minutes, hooting, whistling "School's Out" by Alice Cooper. That sentiment disappaited after about six seconds. Everyone's heart sank simultaneously: two of the three people I was sitting with began crying, and the other two of us sat still, in shock. People, myself included, started numbly roaming the cafeteria, stealing copious amounts of silverware, mugs, and table salt, because the world was ending, and we wanted souvenirs to remember it by. I finessed a fistful of tea-bags, which I wistfully drank for months back at home.
 
Immediately after Covid, about 2 in 3 of my friends dropped out of college. Most of them blamed the sudden shift to online classes, but then, most were not swayed to come back after they were, once again, in-person. I credit my ability to persist through the Quiet Time to my daily meanders through walking-distance woods and lack of usage of social media (except a brief spurt in June, to support those protesting police brutality). My family is lovely, but they do not make the list, because during the roughest part I was of no help to them, and they were of no help to me, due to factors beyond anyone's control.

Anyway, the worst thing to come of this, for my generation, has not been long-covid or brain-fog or sleep apnea. We were raised in the 2000s, a time of frantic paranoia egged on by warhawks. Conventional wisdom was to keep your child monitored at all times, discouraging social engagement outside of supervised, involuntary playdates. Once again, I thank God for my woods time. Us, the "Zoomers", were the first generation raised like this as a whole, and from it we have been dealt a fatal weakness: an inability to socially engage. We almost exclusively date through apps like Tinder and Grindr, with no real social protocols for "dating" because most of us were isolated to only our closest friends (who we value intensely and do not want to "ghost" us) for the bulk of our teens. This is pretty bad on its surface, but reveals further badnesson analysis. This environment led to the majority of men being nonsexual - not asexual. They weren't uninterested, merely unable. The minority of sexual men became more powerful on the dating market in this time period, which (in tandem with lack of cohesive social networks to police such matters) enables many predatory men to traumatize women repeatedly and discreetly. The Dobbs decision, at least in Arkansas, made matters about three times worse.

This was exascerbated, in my case, by I'm sexually attracted to men, assigned male at birth, and have been taking estrogen since 2020, have a visibly female body shape, and wear almost exclusively women's clothing. It is not really available in Arkansas, at least not through any therapist that I've ever had, so I inject black-market internet oil from Brazil. I began in November of 2020, because I had no other choice. I had spent years trying desparately to find some way to avoid a transgender identity, due to the intense transphobia around me. This was typical for the region, but exascerbated by a former member of my squad, who sexually assaulted many of us, and who we justifiably despised, although many of our statements on her were construed for transgender people in general. This gave me a lot of intense fears that I do not understand and that I am not really able to talk about. 

A year or so after the pandemic, the Jimmy John's Work GroupMe lit up my lockscreen. "As food service employees, we're now eligible for the vaccine" - something like that. I immediately called the number my manager had linked, and made an appointment a week on. It was several towns over, but the prospect of not having to worry was so tantalizing that I could not take a later day. When I got the vaccine, I felt a shift. All of a sudden, I could think about the future without getting anxious and forcing myself to stop. It didn't feel good, yet, but I could suddenly see it for the first time in a long time. 


Since I was about 17, I've had a vision of a compact General Game System simple enough for my ten-year-old brother to intuit the use of that's nevertheless capable of

I'm applying to UChicago because I enjoy applied mathematical research, and your PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics is in line with many of my interests. I have almost earned my Bachelor's Degree in both Mathematics and Computer Science from Hendrix College, and in doing so I've learned enough to recognize how wide and incredibly deep both disciplines are. 

My first foray into mathematical research was last year. I began by examining the number of partitions of an n*n grid. The 2*2 case, which is somewhat trivial, is illustrated below.

As I went deeper, I wrote a lot of code to determine particular and general cases. I was careful throughout not to check online sources, so as not to ruin any sort of surprise. I recognized that the problem had likely been done in the past, but for an undergraduate thesis, I felt it important as exercise not to Google it, and to only use as sources my books on Groups, Graphs, and Combinatorics. It was very enjoyable to define my terms, and prove things about them. At one point, after demonstrating with an algorithm that was not remotely feasible by hand that there are 1,434 possible partitions of a 3*3 grid, I wrote a second proof that involved entirely combinatorics, with a method short enough that I could do it by hand, in person. This was nice, and it remained nice the day after I turned in my final copy, when I checked OEIS, and found that the third term of A145835 was the same as what I'd found and proven. I had a good time exploring this problem, and in general, I find ventures in Graph Theory and Combinatorics to be wildly enjoyable, rewarding, and illuminating. Since this paper, I've taken the graph-focused Algorithms class, and my excitement for the discipline has only increased.   

My most recent research project is titled "Hiding Information From The AIs". I have been working in an open-source General Game System called Ludii ( https://ludii.games/ ). When I began work, there were over a thousad games implemented in its embedded programming language, all of which can be played by human players or one of a medley of AIs. I have implemented the first card games in the system, with guidance from my advisor and his general card game system ( https://cardstock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ). This took a lot of work, both in representing gameplay syntactically, and writing a new AI that allowed information to be manually set hidden. This has been great fun for me in many regards. A passionate, esoteric hobby of mine is 2-player abstract strategy games. Before I ever knew what a General Game System was, I had spent many hours poring over Christian Freeling's online archive, boardgamegeek, and Wikipedia, and developed a large register of distinct strategy games playable on some subset of a Go board. With Ludii, Cardstock, and the general  

I'm interested in Machine-Learning in general contexts. In the AI course I am currently taking, I've developed a keen interest in Computational Linguistics that I would never have seen coming. I've found that most applications of AI involve re-expressing your problem with such a grammar that an algorithm may approximate a reasonable answer.

We had a day where the professor went over Transformers, the kind that power modern LLMs, and it was exciting and intriguing the extent that he said "this aspect has been demonstrated to work in practice, but there's not a solid theoretical foundation for why it works yet." There are many aspects of modern machine learning that I'm drawn to because I feel there must exist some hidden body of knowledge that's reachable within my lifetime. Most math gets fully fleshed out theoretically before it finds practical use, such as number theory and cryptography. It's incredible that I was born at the precise right moment to have a large bounty of practical, unexplained heuristics in the form of Deep ML for me and my generation to develop a theory surrounding. An example is the problem of word vectorization. On the first day in AI class, the professor had us prompt the GPT with silly things and get it to lie to us. The point of the exercise, which he announced as it ended, was to demonstrate that "The LLM sees the world as a directed graph of words - but there exists no metric by which it assesses truth, or logical consistency". 

Another way of viewing AI, a more pessimistic approach that my aunt believes, is that instead of "applied linguistics" it is "weaponized data". I don't want to believe that this is the extent of it, but I respect that this property of it is important, practical, and interesting.

The mother of the unsolved AI problems, of course, is generalizability. That's what my work in Ludii has been striving towards. I think a General Video Game AI, based on MCTS with a terse, pygame-style syntax, is feasible in the near future, and my work on General Incomplete-Information AIs has certainly informed this speculation.

Two disciplines that Hendrix does not offer that I greatly enjoy are Journalism and Linguistics. I've worked for our student newsletter for the last two years, and I find the process of researching and writing non-fiction articles extremely rewarding. Last year, our last two issues went unpublished, due to Covid lack-of-will on the part of the publishers. For myself and the people I interviewed, I began hosting those articles on my website, where they are still available to the public. My website, at this point, is gloriously messy, full of Haskell programs and fiction. Writing may be merely a hobby, but the skills I've built in research, storytelling, and information consolidation have absolutely guided me when writing Math or CS research papers. 

Linguistics is something that I did not understand or enjoy until I understood programming language design. Now, I find that a Context-Free grammar is one of the most important combinatoric and computational tools available, and that analysis of the emergent behavior of such a grammar requires pan-disciplinal consideration. One of my esoteric, minor hobbies is constructed languages. I enjoy those with fundamental differences from natural languages, such as Lojban, which is never ambiguous, and Toki Pona, which has less than 150 words, and is the smallest language I'm aware of that I'd assert has the semantic equivalent of Turing-Completeness. 



I hadn't had Algorithms or Combinatorics yet

My most recent research project involved 

	I am very interested in making AI accessible to the public. It is easily the economic area with the largest derivative at present, and I am eager to put my skills in linear algebra, combinatorics, software development, and algorithm design towards it. 

 My introduction to the concept was "Godel, Escher, Bach!", which convinced me of the theoretical potential of the technology, long before I began utilizing it daily. I remember vividly how I felt during my first read of the "Brains and Thoughts" chapter, where Hofstadter establishes, in a loose sense, the way that large groups of theoretical neurons bearing one unit of information each can develop symbols, abstraction and pattern-recognition over time. The fact that my brain engages in a broadly similar process did not make me feel remotely anxious or small then, and it doesn't now. On the contrary, I have found that understanding a complex structure, even in a small way, only adds to its magic, or inherent beauty. 

	With [COMPANY] I hope to work on projects that push the boundaries of what I think is possible. I hope to learn about learning in the natural and comprehensive way that comes with implementation. I look forward to hearing back from [COMPANY].


	When I was young, I was a bit of a nerd, but not a geek. I didn't really like video games, or using the internet. I liked books, writing, and math. Despite this, as I aged, I found that the creative exuberance inherent to good storytelling and mathematics arises consistently in the realm of Software Development. I enjoy the balance of logical problem-solving and personal expression that all such roles require.	
	
	MATHEMATICS
	
	I've loved math since I was a kid. I was raised by Gen-X intellectual types, agnostic, never really went to church. Pursuing and furthering mathematics is close to divinity. It is so much larger and mightier than any human being. I find it so primally fulfilling. That's heresay, though.
I explored two General Game Systems, Ludii and Cardstock, gaining a broad and deep understanding of how they work in general. My research goal was to render a card game in Ludii, because it had not yet been done, despite it being the most robust example that I could find, and because Dr. Goadrich's GGS is specialized for card games. I successfully accomplished this (with many games, including Hearts), and implemented a new AI that plays intelligently without clairvoyance. 

I wrote a 40-page undergraduate thesis titled "Combinatorics of Square Grid Regions". It began by exploring combinatoric counting techniques for partitions of the square grid of size n=3,4, and general. I then implemented an algorithm that created "Galaxies" puzzles (with each partitioned region being 180 degree rotationally symmetric) and rendered them in LaTex. Ultimately, I presented on my research at a conference at Rhodes College. I believe that there is much more that I could explore on this topic.
