I’ve had plenty of good times working! 

The first place I ever did customer service was the Jimmy Johns on College and Salem. I was committed, sure, I’d keep my headset on and speak with the folks at the window in a considerate and reasonable fashion. I answered the phone plenty, and kept a cool demeanor.

There were plenty of problems to be solved there, but I like math more if that’s what I’m after. I’ve taken all the Math classes at Hendrix, even Combinatorics, and everyone in that department is quite dear to me. The only reason I’m still here is that Covid 5 Scholarship. I like math because I believe it is the truest thing available, and it is additionally great exercise. I’ve learned not to give up easily, to always be willing to question my implicit assumptions, and to break problems into smaller problems. I also worked for the department for a couple of years, at the Math Help Center. This was the second place I did customer service, and I learned that the Hendrix student body and the general public can be dealt with in largely similar ways. I was kind and helpful, and very particular about never treating anyone like they were dumb, or somehow inferior, for not knowing something. 

I’m here now taking every Computer Science class at Hendrix. I plan to graduate next year at 20 years old with a double major. I’ve gotten good at working with spreadsheets, databases, code, algorithms, and so on. I currently work for Disco Tray Studios, over in MC Reynolds. In general, this has made me very adaptive, and able to manage complex systems, and wrangle technology. I believe that I would be a productive and engaged member of the HelpDesk Staff.
