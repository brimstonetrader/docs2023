Ay what's up Coulter. You're getting me first person, and conversational, moreso than usual. I went to see my professor Dr. Downes on President's Day, giving her talk on the Metacognition stuff. She's great. She teaches me MATH 490 in the time slot before ENGC 307, and is my thesis advisor. Here were her main points:

STUDY AS IF YOU MUST TEACH THE MATERIAL TO OTHERS

I'll take this opportunity to toot my own horn a little bit. I completed my group's CSCI modules, this week's and last week's, by myself, after the rest of the group threw in the towel after some brutal, intensive sessions of theoretical Haskell coding and "pattern-matching" in Snoddy. I didn't turn them in when I finished them, I turned them in when I was confident that I could explain the algorithms to my partners, and get them to understand. I hope that enacting this piece of advice will serve me well doing the project that's due Friday in that class. 

MONITOR YOUR OWN THINKING // BE CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF YOURSELF AS A PROBLEM SOLVER

This is important in math. Zooming out and zooming in on problems, being aware of yourself and your limitations. Dr. Downes does the advanced-level weekly problem sets like so: half the grade is based on the initial problems turned in, "the draft," graded like standard math. If you're gonna beef it you're really gonna beef it on this half. Then, she gives you the answers, and you must comb through your solutions, correct all mistakes, and explain in detail what went wrong and right. This is the other half of the grade. This process can be excruciating when you become very aware of the extent of your wrongness, but has made me better over the like four classes I've had with her at assessing what I know and what I don't.

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY: 

REMEMBERING < UNDERSTANDING < APPLYING < ANALYZING < EVALUATING < CREATING < BEING THE BEST IN THE MF WORLD

What I like about the pyramid structure is that it reinforces that everything falls apart when you don't have a solid foundation. That's what I like about my job in the Math Help Center. Keeps my Calculus and Algebra skills brimming near the surface, keeps me from thinking I'm high and mighty when a Prequestion is tough.

CORNELL STYLE NOTES: NOTES WITH A SECTION OFF TO THE SIDE ANNOTATING IT DONE AS REVIEW

I just thought this was a good idea Dr. Downes mentioned. Thought it was worth including. ^_^.
