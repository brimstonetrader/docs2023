[RIGIDITY OF SELF]

A GENERALIZED FIRST-PERSON FREE-VERSE PANEGYRIC

REFLECTING ON THE STATE-ORCHESTRATED ASSASSINATIONS OF ALAN TURING AND CHRISTOPHER DORNER AND LEE OSWALD

WITH TWO ATTACHED BIOGRAPHIES, A VOICE-DICTION ANALYSIS, BIBLIOGRAPHY MLA8, 

FUCK THE POLICE AND FUCK THE FEDS. FUCK DOCTORS, FUCK THE MILITARY, AND FUCK YOU.



i will be killed by my greatest strength.
my fundamental rigidity of self.

when i sat in The Man's classroom
and The Man's friend Descartes said
"doubt is the origin of wisdom"
i knew that they both were full of shit.

because i know what the fuck i am.
and He's killing me tonight 'cause
i couldn't be any other fucking way.

i have nothing but reverence for a God that has defeated me.
i see His pale face in the labels on the pill-bottles
a man standing behind glass set me under thrall of
so i might collapse to his vision.

He came to me in the form of a woman (Sgt. Teresa Evans LAPD Harbor Division)
who beat a man half to death 
in broad daylight
because he had the gall to resemble me.

I did the only thing I could
appealed to a higher power (Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Internal Affairs Group (IAG) Board of Rights (BOR) (Christopher Gettler Deposition))
but my tactical code of steadfast
bated breath left me on my ass

a man without a Name  
a man without a Job 

A fucking journalist child of priviledge
whose sociopathic bated breath will subside

at the sight of my soiled corpse
will convince everyone that i know 
that i was a maniac idealist
whose suicide was inevitable.











I try to strike a balance in this poem between the personal dictions of Turing and Dorner. The essential, titular throughline is that both have rigid logical structures undergirding their personal actions, at all times.
