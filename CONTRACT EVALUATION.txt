I PLAN ON COMPLETING ALL MODULES, GETTING PROJECTS 1 AND 2 TO LEVEL 3, AND GETTING PROJECTS 3 AND 4 TO AT LEAST LEVEL 2 (ALTHOUGH I AM QUITE EXCITED ABOUT PROJECT 4).

THUS FAR I HAVE COMPLETED ALL ASSIGNMENTS. I RESUBMITTED MODULE 4 WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS OF GETTING IT BACK. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HASKELL, AND FEEL MORE CONFIDENT IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF BINARY TREES AND STANDARD PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COMPONENTS. I LIKE THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLASS, I LIKE MY GROUP. I THINK HAVING TWO DAYS INSTEAD OF ONE DAY A WEEK OF LECTURE WOULD BE SIMILARLY, MAYBE A LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVE. I SEE BOTH SIDES THOUGH. I'VE KEPT UP MY END SO FAR.
