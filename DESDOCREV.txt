2 OF 5 AR HISTORY GOALS.

DEVELOP SUPPORTING QUESTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INQUIRY: IDENTIFYING FACTS, CONCEPTS, AND INTERPRETATIONS

    STUDENTS, WE HOPE, WILL FIND THEMSELVES THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE TOWNS THAT THEY LIVE IN ARE BUILT IN A CRITICAL MANNER. THEY'LL CONSIDER, IN A BROAD WAY, WHERE THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVE IN RELATION TO THEIR WORKPLACE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GREENSPACE AND SOCIAL SPACES FOR PERSONAL WELL-BEING.

CONSTRUCT COMPELLING QUESTIONS THAT PROMOTE INQUIRY AROUND KEY IDEAS AND ISSUES    

    WE WANT STUDENTS TO QUESTION ARKANSAN CITY PLANNING, WHICH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY CAR-DEPENDENT, FROM A PRAGMATIC, COST-BENEFIT STANDPOINT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, BUT ESSENTIAL IF WE EVER WANT A SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT OUR TOWNS ARE LAID OUT. WE WILL SCORE BY AN AVERAGE OF THE COMMUTE TIME BY FOOT, BIKE, BUS, AND CAR, AS MANY ARKANSAN CHILDREN AREN'T VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE FORMER THREE AS VIABLE TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR ADULTS, IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WILL INCLUDE SOME HISTORICAL SLIDES, TAKING THE USER THROUGH A MILD, ~5 MINUTE PRESENTATION ON THE HISTORY OF TRANSIT IN ARKANSAS, RENDERED IN THE GAME'S ABSTRACT ART STYLE, ENDING WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE THREAT GAS-POWERED ENGINES POSE TO THE CLIMATE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD CITY PLANNING IN ANY LONG-TERM VIABLE PLAN TO REDUCE CARBON EMMISIONS.
