First off, tell me about your Watson on public art.

How has Hendrix (through undergrad and AGS) helped you hone your artistic skills, identity, and vision? What other factors have been influential?

Your first experience having art displayed publicly (Ain't I A Woman?) got sort of dampened by the virus and vandal. How does public art persist in the face of renegade Trumpers?

will this inform your study of worldwide public art?

How has that business minor helped your artistic career?

Tell me about your purely aesthetic inspirations (expressive faces, vivid backdrops, calm).

You thread together artistic and African-American history in novel, thought-provoking ways.
