Mona

The narrator. She technically had the initial idea, and has stuck around as "CEO". She's got Damon, Damon's Dad, Stephen, D, bread, Guillermo, Sadie, Alan, and 629-16-4529 bugged, and is very willing to lie, and as such can describe scenes in rooms she is not in and so forth. She did this to her former boyfriend, is why none of that squad wants to hang out, and Stephen takes it willingly once Damon starts telling him things he's not telling her. She's writing this on a tumblr-type blog she has set to private up until near the end. She is witty, white, cis, and bisexual.

Damon


You love him. Your homework for the next week is to write the interview, notated like a script. Have Mona offer to be CEO, Stephen, CFO. This is the Ozark crew. Edgy racist white dude.

The out-of-touch-with-reality old ass man BREAD has lived with for a decade and a half now. He cares for BREAD, but can seem cold. Native Belgian who got evacuated because his father was Jewish. He doesn't really talk about it, but it informs him, and he's weary of the whole thing from the get-go.

"BREAD", or, Terrance Wu

After "Uppers", moves in with Steg, gets addicted to Weed Ketamine and Adderall, and creates CubeWorld. Makes a bil, has the Notch shit happen to him.

Guillermo, the OP. (Actually Sparky with a pseudonym).

Yeah, Guillermo's real name is Sim Parker Jr. and he works for the CIA in the Urban Unhoused Usurption Unit. Allen's on good terms with him, calling him "the ultimate intern", and thinks he's a scrappy, somewhat illegal immigrant out of Mexico. He gets bugged when he downloads a file Stephen sends him with a Trojan horse, which is how we hear his convos with Damon, Allen, and Mr. Hell.

Article published Aug 9, 2042 in the Austin Inquirer, written by Shamrock Sheep, a lifestyle guru slash journalist, who was paid today’s equivalent of $15,000 for the trouble. I include it, not out of reverence, but sheer laziness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

It really is absurd how much difference a schmear of makeup and a photo editing software suite can make in someone’s age. From the pictures I had seen on the internet, I would have pegged Damon for 40. His given age was 46, but anyone who believes those sorts of statistics about the powerful is gullible enough to join the army. Sitting across from the weary flesh-man, it was clear that gravity had done a number on him. It was possible that he was under 50, but his bones had clearly grown far, far more haggard than that. It wasn’t that he had lived a particularly strenuous life, judging by his appearance, but merely one of little to no personal upkeep, rot that spread into his core. Ordinarily I wouldn’t judge someone over something petty like that, but there was enough to get mad at Damon for outside of his appearance that I felt comfortable with my snide little observations. He noticed me grinning.

“What’s so humorous?”, he asked blithely as I straightened myself out and readied my notepad. 

“I was laughing at an unrelated thing”, I blurted, knowing that he would recognize the reference and back down. “Let’s start at the beginning”.

Brayden readied himself and began to consider. “Well, the first really interesting thing that happened to me was when my parents got divorced in ‘04. I took it pretty hard, I guess you could say it was traumatic”. He seemed at a loss for much to say on the early portion of his life. “I didn’t really have a lot of friends. Most of my time was spent gaming, just sort of waiting for that part of my life to be over”. 

“What were you waiting for that was unattainable at that point?”

“Ah, nothing really. Getting a job, getting my own place. There wasn’t really a goal at that point. I had so little ambition. I probably would have gotten suicidal if I had the energy. Can I just skip to the interesting part?”

I sighed. “Fine, but all of that stuff’s already out there. It wouldn’t be that interesting to publish a bunch of shit everyone knows already”.

He continued unfazed. “I was working this job at a Jimmy Johns in Frisco, Texas. You ever go to Frisco?”

“Nah, no way.”

“Ah, it’s not so bad. Really well-maintained. People there were very closed off though, maybe it was just that first covid year but I felt really disliked there, mostly. There was one exception, this wonderful guy named Eric. I got along really well with him because we were both from the Midwest, me from Minneapolis and him a Yooper. I was buying acid from him maybe 2 times a month. Eventually, he asked me, ‘Do you want to know where your money is going?’. I said yes. He showed me this account he had on some, fucking dogshit app. It was called, like, ‘oxenfree’ or something, all on dogecoin. He told me about how it was due to explode, and I had been putting away a little money, given that I was living with my parents at the time with weed as my only real expense. I put, oh, five hundred on it because, basically, at the time I was gullible as fuck, and, well, you saw the news from there. I sold the second Elon walked on that SNL stage, and instantly had over ten million dollars in my checking account.” 

He began grinning. He was so self-satisfied. I must admit, he is one of those rare billionaires who can claim to be entirely self-made. 





So he gets real serious. He straightens up












I first met Damon through work. He had just moved to Ozark, and we were stationed at the same Jimmy Johns. I disliked him immensely, because we had a lot in common. He was a reddit troglodyte, bound to an endless drip of hypercurated content, which in his case had eroded mostly to hero worship of a White South African man named Takyon D’Ursula.


Damon scowled across the table at Steven. It was suddenly clear that any vestige of empathy was but a mirage, and the clinical landlord’s priorities were at once in order. “You don’t get to speak to me like that”, he said firmly. “Now go back to your fucking box”. Damon stared daggers at Steven for a little while longer, and walked out of the room. 

Steven knew the score. This didn’t come as a surprise to him, as Damon likely expected it to. He 








He initially leads a vapid, lecherous existence, has a religious vision while tripping of mario, develops a religious framework, “ends homelessness”, exotic animal mauling










“You know, obviously it’s nice to jerk off sober, but I almost never do it. Getting high is, let’s say, a given. Now-”, he glances around, maybe looking for a particular person, who mustn't have been there as he goes on. “It sort of takes me out of the moment. Lets the orgasm almost take me by surprise. There’s really no substitute.” He continues to eat his chicken tenders. 

“I find it usually takes me by surprise, no matter what I’m on”, I rebut aloofly. “Chalk it up to gender differences”, Damon says, with his mouth full. There is an awkward silence.


















a big leaf-looking thing sits idly on a pibe tree branch. i brush by, brashly, and it flaps its leaves like a bird might. i flinch, then grin. you look at me quizzically. “so you’ve gotta tell me the damon story”. man. alright. 




damon is born in minnesota, picks up the accent, middles through high school


he does psychs for a week straight to determine how to use his 35 mil. mostly just plays minecraft, decides not to jack off, gurns at mother. on the seventh day, he goes outside and is accosted by a homeless meth addict. he vows to house as many people as he can off the funds. 


once he opens cubeland, steven, a plucky college junior moves in. he worms himself in as a thorn in damon’s side, rich enough to buy a regular apartment. the two become somewhat friendly, and the atmosphere there is sort of electric, like, “everything could very well change off this”. 

“do you know what that fucking land used to be, steven? do you?”. a pause. he’s crying now. “my aunt’s house, steven. they bulldozed the damn place. we sit, at this horrendous fucking college, eagerly perched with cups and bowls at a well overflowing with blood. you better not fucking do that again”. 


in the immediate run up to the silicon valley cube, damon gets gored on an exotic animal safari by a hippo, and leaves the company to steven. he makes efforts to connect it to bart and do smart city planning, banning cars, right before the collapse.

or, “workaholics”, or, “effective altruism”

0. Instantiation!

Let me spin you a yarn, dear reader, of the sudden appearance of my glorious benefactor!

I, 5’6, was working at a chain sandwich shop, “Samwiches”, in some medium-sized town, let’s call it “Whitehaven”, square in the asshole of Ozarkia. The decor bled neon, attitude-laden pleasantries and twisted aphorisms shooting through the reader like subatomic particles, never colliding with anything capable of sensory processing, nay, even a simple “vibe check”. Our quote unquote leader, the titular man who had never met anyone who I had met, was one Horatio Sam, who seemed large but not jolly, shrewd. His hollow eyes blared at all times, via larger-than-life portrait above the make-line. He was the first white guy to think of putting avocado on a sandwich, and with the millions he generated he spent his latter days hunting exotic game in foreign countries, having sold the company to Dining Style Inc. His gaze lit no spark of ambition within me, dear reader. I was a vicious stoner, diametrically opposed to the idea of doing anything, sans “sparking up” or playing Let’s Go! Pets 3. Oh mercy, I was a lost cause! I made 300 dollars a week, living free and comfortable at my mother’s house, spending it all on joysticks and noisemakers. After I dropped out sophomore year, leaving behind a sizable Women in Journalism scholarship, I languished in stasis 18 coronaviral months, setting my pen in the chest-of-drawers by my bedside, next to all my other, indefinitely suspended, dreams. What follows, is the series of events since then that have spurred me to relift it, to once again document. 

1. A Surface-Level Anecdote, So The Reader Might Glean A Mote Of Insight Into The Character Of One Damon Noid.

I was engaged in conversation with my coworker, Aidan. Aidan, like most of my coworkers, belongs to the Beta Omicron Chi fraternity, at PSU a little down the road. Most of these types blend together for me, but Aidan stuck out enough that I remembered his name. Mostly, he was the only one even close to my height, meaning I managed to see more than his chin, which, like the rest of them, was pointy, and irregularly bearded. Anyway, Aidan began to give me the breakdown re. the previous day, a day in which he found himself again encased within this self-same establishment. 

He was working with Damon Noid, a weirdo with Minnesota plates and a microchip on his shoulder, 5’5. Despite the lax nature of the “Sandwich Boys” uniform, he was breaking the dress code in several ways, pajama pants littered with holes, Deadpool shirt, he smelled bad. The managers, newly declawed what with that aforementioned Covid virus, couldn’t really say shit. Aidan asked him what his deal was. “I’m kind of a piece of shit, man”, Damon said with alacrity that felt forced, unnatural. He was older than most of the college-kid coworkers, at least 25 or 26, and already balding. “I’m here ‘cause of an ex-wife restraining order.” It was a four person shift, with one other indistinguishable frat guy named Lodin and this annoying nerd Francis Bauer, maybe 6’1, heavyset, smelly, and greasy. I had long ago convinced the manager, D., not to schedule me with him when he could avoid it ‘cause he followed this girl I know home once, but on the rare occasions we did work together he was resolutely disinterested in anything I had to say or do. That was actually pretty nice, I could just sit on my phone 80% of the time, pampering my virtual anteater. Anyway, Lodin and Aidan were both out on delivery, and Aidan got back first. He clocked in to a silent shop, an egregious abnormality, and tiptoed into the lobby. He saw, for a few brief moments, Francis and Damon, still, standing, facing each other. Francis’ shirt, as per usual, failed to cover the full extent of his drooping stomach fat, and the spillover was being held with both hands by Damon. They were maintaining electric eye contact, and seemed to be enjoying themselves stoically, up until they noticed Aidan and scrambled, yelling and rustling shit up in service of a doomed impulse to distract, to come up with a different thing to talk about. 

2. I  Witness A Crime

Aidan, having finished the story, asked, “Ain’t that some shit?” It really wasn’t, I’ve seen worse shit on the local news, but it was fine. 

I said, “Yeah, gas anecdote.” 

Damon was back at work tonight, but instead of Francis we had Geraldo, who was unspeakably attractive, and sold weed, psychs, and pills. He was in a committed relationship, still, with his girlfriend from high school, which ensured that we rarely talked. He managed that night, with a lovely “hands off” approach. We were busy, but during a lull I introduced myself to Damon, careful not to reveal that I knew his name. He awkwardly informed me that he was bisexual and a furry, and scrunched his face up like a rat, rubbing his temples.

He walked away from me and toward Geraldo, grimace upside-downifying into a radiant smile. “Evening, officer, wondered if I might acquire myself five of those little pieces of paper we discussed the other day.” Geraldo grinned goofy, and led Damon to the back. They came out with three little pieces of paper, Damon having eaten two. He made that much clear to me once he got back. With malaise and dread at all his various tips, he asked, “you do acid?”

In fact, I did “do” acid, not quite habitually, but certainly enough that I knew not to drop after 6, 8 at the latest. Besides, the garish shop bore a cloud of hostile energy visible even to the unfettered eye. I considered asking if I could get a tab, just, like, for later, but I was broke. 

3. I Commit a Crime

At that point, a karenish woman ushered in a steady trickle of like-minds, via the drive-thru. Geraldo took his time with pride, contentedly performing over the intercom, register, and makeline, not quite simultaneously. He had come back off break ten minutes previous, smelling of bad eggs and fumes. Damon, ticking like a bomb, grabbed a cup of ice water, and took off his apron. I could tell that he planned on smoking marijuana, because he told Aidan, “I’m going to go smoke some marijuana on the roof.” He asked if anyone cared to join. Geraldo, after a moment of consideration, did not, and Aidan ignored the question entirely. I glanced around, and thought critically for a moment. I had a girly pepper spray keychain on my person, as well as several sharp objects and a whistle in my purse. Further, this Damon dude was empty behind the eyes, and if he tried to grab me up on the roof I could just holler. I accompanied him up the ladder, politely toting the comically-oversized-for-stealth-purposes bong. We faced four weathered folding chairs beat in by the elements, all facing a central table. The view up there was unremarkable: the sunset likely would have been beautiful if an orange cloudy haze didn’t shield all but the closest strip-mall from view. He packed a generous bowl of maybe 0.6 grams, with a pinch of rosin plucked with tweezers from a little dab-case. He gave me greens, so I didn’t start things by expressing sexual disinterest. 

I asked, “What brought you to Arkansas?” His parents, as it turns out, moved here a couple years back. His ex-wife got all his friends in the divorce, and the process for transferring to a different state’s Samwiches was simple, informal. We employees know a like-mind on sight.

He asked me, “Do you go to school?” This was a likely attempt to suss out whether I was ‘legal’, which I was, albeit uneager to share this information. 

I said, “Yeah, but I’m on break right now,” keeping it vague and moving on. “What do you do in your spare time?”

He smirked like he was formulating a half truth. “I spend a lot of time on reddit,” he said confidently, “I’m basically a bastard spawn of the internet, would be the best way to put it.” This was what piqued my interest. Earlier that year a bunch of odious incels, forumheads, and creepers pulled a scam with the stock-trading app, jacking up the price of this one radio parts company a thousand fold. The crypto nerds kept the wave going, and basically issued millions on millions to those “bastard spawn” who spent enough time online to have heard about it early. It was probably the first occurrence in world history of a massive pattern of wealth redistribution towards the most annoying portion of the population, without regard for class or vocation. This man, indeed, was profoundly annoying. We finished the bowl, decided to leave the bong there, and headed back into the store, putting on aprons, I tied my hair back. The line at the drive through had not shrunken at any point, and was now about 5 cars long. We slung lackadaisically, insulting customers to their faces. 

An in-shop came in, a three-or-four instance-per-shift rarity in the viral days. It was Hal, a big fucking guy with bones for teeth, a rootin’-tootin’ white man who was always trying to strike up a god-damned conversation, but gave every employee he could find a 20-bill in December. Nobody liked him, but you had to paint a smile on, cause he was friends with the father of the middling 45-year-old stoner who, on paper, owned the establishment. Damon began to take his order. He always wanted the double beef sub with extra mayo, pickles and onions, hold the cheese. He paid with a 20 and told Damon to keep the change, adding “I’ll bet that made your night, didn’t it?” 

Damon, scowling, said “No way man. My money makes money that makes more than that in a day. I’m just here to keep myself company.”

Hal was upset. His pet peeve was a lack of subservience in others, and the hairs on his arm were standing on end on little goose pimples. He wasn’t gonna yell, again, as last time he tried something like that his daughter found a video of it on SlipSlop, a short-form content generation algorithm popular with the Covid kids. He merely stopped talking, made a mental note not to pay the dirty white guy who smelled like weed, and scooted out promptly. We were impressed. He said he lied, to get Hal out of the store, but once 9 rolled around and Damon and I clocked out, he led me again up to the roof, promising more weed and “the whole story.”

5. The Transcript Of The Interview I Conducted With Damon On The Night Of 2021.03.25 [CONDENSED FOR BREVITY]

I followed Damon up to the roof, taking the precaution

NARRATRIX: Do you mind if I record you? I’m something of an aspiring author. 

DAMON: Go for it, just don’t tell any Samwichers. I just don’t want to get treated any differently, you know. Always getting asked for money and stuff. I’ve seen it all before. 

NARRATRIX: *nodding, compassionate* I truly understand. 

DAMON: Thank you, you’re sweet.

alan and the cia would like to utilize the massive cubic building housing over 29,997 formerly homeless people on the ocean of the san silicon bay as a data cultivation firm for a neural network. they use vr helmets that are “freaky, don’t feel like screens” and navigate social situations. they do, creating a functional, constantly learning, “artificially emotional and reasonable” program. this ai is very popular and utilized in recreational programs damon and the likable band of freeloaders (the narrator key among them, the “highest paid sex worker in history” as sort of money laundering through an app) fail to properly maintain the building over time, consistently lacking in important utilities, functional transit, and options to be outside. nevertheless, it touts as a sustainable lifestyle, with “work” only 4 days a week and provided housing food and 60$ “entertainment” budget, as well as furnishings utilities communist grocery store cantina “public transit” and online school. things skip ahead a year when the narrator goes to jail. damon and alan are lsd and dmt-ridden wrecks. most essential managerial functions are performed by cia creeps, some functions performed by formerly homeless as labor-for-housing such as cooking, cleaning, etc. these jobs are highly desirable. damon lives in the cube in an 8 bedroom suite on the top middle. 






n. Fall of Crypto


Terrence "Methuselah of the Unincorporated Community right on the southern edge of Crittenden County most locals just call West Memphis despite it being about fifteen minutes by car outside the official city limits" Wu grew up an only child, slightly wealthier than his schoolmates, who mostly lived within a mile of the bridge and broadly thought of themselves, in the context of their own lives, as "city folk", or perhaps “suburban,” if they were shrewd. As an adolescent he felt put upon, isolated, like a misshapen social ogre whose lack of exposure to kids his own age forced the exponentially growing, “quick” negative-feedback wheel keep on-a turning. He spent his nights playing "logic games", doodling analog circuits and soloing Risk and Pandemic, Ticket to Ride, and larger projects that existed only in his mind. His days, out of a lack of other options, were spent in the mile-long radius of woods surrounding his family's home, rapturously soaking in the splendor of youth, yonder, and Vitamin D, staring at mushrooms, and, if the sun was setting, walking up the great big hill and splaying out in the dried-out sandy crevice up on top, bugs squirming out from under his ass and legs, glasses off. Terrence was calm, meditative, strikingly happy in spite of his lack of friends. His knack for sitting with himself unperturbed was one of the few traits from this era he took active steps to preserve. He never wore headphones, or earbuds, or AirPods, spoke rarely, and watched television only when accompanied, even after he got rich.
In high school he fell in with the Weird Kids in a class of sixty or so, which in a town that small was a broad coterie you fell into if you were a Weeb, Gay, Alt, Nerd, Edgelord, Left-Wing, Goth, Autistic, and/or not White. Infighting was common. It was the third largest clique, following the Neon Jocks and Rich Girls, and was composed primarily of White Autistic Weebs, among whom Terrence felt mildly comfortable, but certainly built up no affinity. He graduated quietly, receiving very little applause, making no plans for college or work, and maintaining friendships with no one. In spite of his parent's having offered countless times to buy him a smartphone or car, anxious to make the young boy maintain an ever-present tracking device using one of those spyware apps you read about on NextDoor, or a fossil fuel dependency. He never obliged, as he didn't really see why you'd ever want to talk to someone who wasn't actually there, or usually, someone who was. For sixty-six months, his parents and grandparents politely ignored the future, and enjoyed the boy for who he was. It was a summer that stretched into October five years later, a time Terrence largely spent hammocking. On his twenty-third birthday, Terrence's parents gave him the American Ultimatum. They told him that he was a man, and that he had had enough life experience by that point to make it on his own. They gave him two thousand dollars, vaguely implying that he could ask for more in around half a year, and told him to visit often, but to kindly clear out by the end of the week, as his grandmother wanted to set up his room as her studio. Terrence’s father patted him on the shoulder, fake-smiling, and told him that they were only doing this because they loved him. 
	Terrence was vexed by the eviction. He was not capable of driving, so his parents gave him a bicycle that was a little rusted, but barely used. Big River Crossing was four hours northeast, was what they said, ride to Tennessee, where you will find a job, a wife, and a city far more tremendous in size and scope than even wide, dimly-lit West Memphis! He spent a few days lethargic, ruminating, nostalgia congesting mind-tubes and brute motor functions like a five gallon drum of lard oil forced down a Standard American Commode via advanced plunger tactics. On packing his bags, which he took pride in slimming down to a backpack with four changes of clothes and some essential consumables, the two thousand dollars, a MacBook Pro his Grandpa had gotten him the Christmas before that he had not set up yet, and a large suitcase he figured out how to latch to the back of the bike containing several hundred pages of graph paper, pens, and all the board game shit.
On the last day, he realized something that made him feel hideous. He had not been to the woods the entire previous week. He dashed out, 5:30 PM harboring a slight darkening in the sky, some splendid colors, nighttime’s careful omens. The little carved out entrance was still there, the rock path, brushy shrubs, all of the trees seemed to be in order. He continued, now mindless, at ease. The sole aberration came five minutes in. He noticed a neon blue flap poking out from behind a charming slender pine in the background, and pushed toward it, noting that the sky was darkening at a quickening rate. The flap was a part of a tent, in which a homeless man was drinking from a can of Vegetarian Vegetable soup that he had decondensed in a pot with some water, and heated in a little flame circle he’d made right next to the door, with the provided kindling. The nomad noticed the rustling that Terrence had caused, with the branches, and said a calm “Hello,” beginning to exit. He didn’t want to be perceived as frightening, or as a nuisance. “I’m sorry.” 
Terrence smirked. His Ozark education had taught him about people like this. “Are you homeless?” 
The nomad was fazed, clearly put off. He lied, “No, no. I just love camping, I’m out here constantly. Every day I’m with the trees.”
Terrence was now skeptical. “Well then why haven’t I seen you around then, Mister Camper?” He was overconfident, certain in himself as the “alpha” of the situation. 
“I didn’t mean these specific woods, nah, I was talking more broadly.” Terrence furrowed his brow. The nomad continued, “I’m a wanderer, really. It’s not so bad, especially out here in the States. They’ve got church orgs out here, passing out food and coffee on Tuesdays. You can get ten or fifteen bucks profit spanging off the highway, no qualms from no one if you pay off Captain Sorrels.  What’s the alternative, and how is it better, really?”
Terrence was confused. He’d never imagined someone who’d resort to homelessness, not out of necessity, but ideology. He considered his own impending homelessness, and decided that the concept angered him, as he noticed the man before him, in his smelly t-shirt, and spotless Yeezys, as a brutish, stupid living contradiction: an oxy moron. “What, are you just gonna mooch off Mom and Pop ‘til someone dies?” He collected himself. “What about the nights where it gets really cold? Do you pull some credit card with another man’s name out your asshole, and get a hotel room, you lazy prick?”
The man sagely shook his head. “When it is cold I wrap myself in several blankets, and wrap the result in my bivy bag. When I am hungry I eat what I am able to gather, like any man. I do not communicate with my parents, or anyone. I am not insane.”    
Terrence, incredulous, continued to pester the man, convinced he was somehow inauthentic. “Life can’t be one big fucking party, man!” He yanked the tent flap, flailing for no reason at a man who hadn’t done anything wrong, and jostled free a couple oblong clear glass pipes, one of which shattered on a nearby rock. There were a couple needles visible now, of which Terrance was at the time unaware of any nefarious ancillary use, quaintly ironic. He maintained his glare, as if he was unaware that he had done something wrong. He thought the nomad would respond well to authority, which he of course didn’t, but like most nomads, he wasn’t a fighter when he didn’t think his life was in danger. 
After a seven second staring contest, Terrance turned his back and indignantly stomped out the woods the way he came, something he tried his best to never do, and arrived glum and pessimistic at the house he’d once called home. His Grandpa was the only one in the living room. He beckoned Terrance over, leaned real close, and gave him a small red box, covered in lace, with two white rabbits arranged with 180° rotational symmetry emblazoned along the front, which he told him to only open if he felt truly, unalterably hopeless, or if the reverse was true, a concept on which his Grandpa was cloudy on the specifics of. Grandpa closed his eyes, sleeping on the couch with COPS on in the background as he usually did. Terrance retired, sleeping in his childhood bed for the last time, catching off-glimpses of his empty room.

Narrator, met Dante at Big Boy’s Banh Mi, a westernized fast food place. Finds that he recently became a dogecoin millionaire and has elected to become a “dangerous” sort of landlord. Nebulous moves in along with three friends from the neighborhood, who in addition to Dante and Steven form the main cast. Nebulous gets in as CTO with very little experience. They begin the development charging 150$/month for rent, under a third of the closest, for cubes. Cubes are half bedroom half living room, no kitchen, with complimentary doordash. Dante lives in a 2x2x2, with a big kitchen he only uses for beef. 


ngl, i’ve been writing a lot of stuff about CubeLand lately. I like it there. My last piece, the one with the title ending in “Uppers”, folds into it too. You’ll see.

"Take 5, D."


Fred and D sat in plastic lawn chairs, watching a compilation of bugs getting squashed on the provided phone-dock-to-projector-hookup, with the rank, spiderwebbed concrete walls providing a hazy grey undertone to the cube, dimly lit by LED vibe lights set to blue. There were three other lawn chairs in a stack over in a corner, and, in the entire room, two other major things, the first of which was a mildewy, gnawed-down acoustic guitar onto which D mostly played alt and punk covers. The second item, or rather, group of items unified under a theme, was a large, filthy bong and about three ounces split into two bags, one labelled "Zkittlez" and one labelled "Ice Cream Cake". 

D paid the thirty-five dollar rent every month on the cube, not because he was broke, living there out of necessity, like a lot of the sad sacks who habitually were at CubeLand Zero, the supposedly historic, experimental, and alternative living facility his dopey, gopherish coworker Damon had converted the storage unit facility next to his house into. He was there because his fiancee, Tina, was pissed at him, and for good reason. She didn’t like that he sold weed, because he was on probation, and didn’t really need the extra money. Tina’s sister had fallen for a pill dealer (just xans, but he got a year) when Tina was maybe fourteen, and she’d since always tried to avoid finding herself in that situation, talking through god-damned glass to your life partner. That dude was still in jail, but by the moment right before the present, her sister had moved on. 

D would drive up to his cube and “wait it out” when Tina got really pissed at him, when she started crying and screaming that she didn't want to marry him. D didn't understand his wife's problem. He thought that was nice, that he was already calling her "wife." She had a rough childhood, and could happily live off potatoes, oil, and seasonings for as long as the circumstances dictated, but D craved pleasure grander in scope. He shopped at Fresh Market, buying olives and take-out trays, bergamot, rye, and that sort of thing. He had a very good gaming desktop that he had invested quite a bit of time, money, and energy into, and used the Stocks app daily, to his credit score's chagrin.

D and Fred knew each other from work. They were both managers at Samwiches, Fred in the day, D in the night. They both made around 30K a year after taxes, and they had known of each other since high school. Fred was three years older than D, and an all-around better guy, being the only one of the two to have actually graduated, successfully maintained a relationship longer than a year, made friends in jail, or walked in May of 2020. He was chilling with D because he had nothing better to do. 

Fred maintained his cube, like D, for ancillary purposes, as a safe, walkable place to store, buy, and sell low-tier, weed-and-psychs-type drugs. Fred had a girlfriend, actually, who didn't have any problem with him as far as I know, but he'd honed in on the lack of cops. CubeLand's residents were famously anonymous, encrypted by a shitty sort-of compressionish Caeser-cypher-type algorithm Stephen claimed was the blockchain. Fred had just sold D the three ounces. He paid five hundred bucks. Fred was feeling generous, because the week previous D had covered two of his shifts. Fred was more focused on bulk, big picture stuff. He'd never actually gotten caught for dealing. The only time he went to jail, for five months when he was 20 for regular assault, he actually got exonerated officially, and released early. The governor apologized, and he got a tidy settlement out of the whole thing: money that he had since spent all of, sure, but money well spent. He was doing fine now. Since he'd become manager he'd balanced his own budget, Bill Clinton style, and paid off the $800 in credit card debt that he'd maintained. Fred was supposed to graduate the following semester, Business, and he told people he intended to move out of the South, and get a "real job" with Samwiches Corporate. 


Since most of the founders had left, an "anything goes" mentality pervaded in CubeLand Zero. The clientele was almost exclusively men, cis-hetero-normative men, at that. From what Fred told me, in a big winding monologue that was pretty self-reflective for a guy, the vibes were akin to a locker room in an '80s movie. Nude, wandering men were constant presences, and door-to-door dealers would knock, quietly and politely, every couple of minutes or so, distributing primarily illicit psychoactive drugs, but also, on occasion, food and water. It was pretty obviously Damon's first draft. There wasn't a shiny jobs guarantee like he'd set up in Alamo, no planned connection to existing public transit infrastructure like San Silicon. It was a stack of concrete, with warmly wallpapered and carpeted hallways. At this point, maybe 500 or so transient homeless types had taken up residence in the cubes, and about the same amount of local, homeful men had followed their lead. Then came the college kids, then came the gawkers.



























## basically D and Fred get proper stoned and jam a little bit, until they head outside, hearing loud and    
## violent fervor. It turns out that part of the roof caved in, wiping out four rooms, killing two. The 
## facility's manager (technically still Steven) is out in California, and indignantly quit his post a week or 
## so earlier. Then the molotov cocktails start flying, then the building collapses. We have this extremely detailed
## report because Fred livestreamed a lot of it, and Mona's on Fred's story. This is one of the final chapters,  
## although the end officially comes when the Alamo branches hear about SS and OZK, and march into the town
