About Final Projects

Final Project, due Wed., May 3, 8:30 a.m.

Length requirements: 6-8 pages if poetry (no more than 10); 10-12 pages (no more than 15) if prose, drama, or mixed

Your final project should be an act of written witness in your genre of choice—poetry, fiction, drama, or creative nonfiction. The situation or incident you recount can be real or imagined, historic or personal. Your work should reflect the idea of witness as you have come to understand it through this semester’s readings: the responsibilities and challenges that come with bearing witness; the relationship between personal and political experience; how the act of witness changes the writer or audience; and whatever ambiguities and profundities pertain.

Genre considerations: You may expand and revise a piece you wrote in the earlier part of the course; or you may write a new piece. If you choose to expand an earlier piece, you must correct every grammatical error or typo that I’ve marked in the Exploratory version, and I will appreciate evidence that you also considered applying the artistic advice as well. For poetry, you may work in any poetic form, including free verse.

Subjects of witness might include (but are not limited to)

· events of historic significance,

· events indicating social or cultural change,

· encounters across cultural, racial, or ethnic borders,

· acts of violence relating to societal pressures,

· hate crimes,

· stories of allyship,

· testimony that shines a light on “unsung lives” who would

otherwise go unknown to the world at large,

· acts of environmental degradation,

· social or political protest,

· war and peacemaking,

· revolution,

· social displacement or migration,

· animal welfare,

· or personal (economic, medical, etc.) trauma.

Seek to express the larger amplifications of the witnessed event beyond its immediate effects on the individuals.

Note: This project is about an act of witness to something real, even if you choose a fictional treatment. No horror, fantasy, or science fiction will be accepted. Elements of magical realism are acceptable
