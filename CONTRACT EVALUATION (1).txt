I PLAN ON COMPLETING ALL MODULES, GETTING PROJECTS 2 AND 3 TO LEVEL 3, AND GETTING PROJECT 4 TO AT LEAST LEVEL 2.

THUS FAR I HAVE COMPLETED ALL ASSIGNMENTS. I RESUBMITTED MODULE 4 WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS OF GETTING IT BACK. 

THE MAIN THING IN THIS CLASS IS BUILDING RECURSIVE STRUCTURES. I'VE LEARNED HASKELL CODE AND CHANGED MY VISUAL STUDIO TO RED. I HAVE LEARNED WHAT ERRORS ARE, AND HOW THEY CAN BE USED TO BROADEN THE POSSIBLE USES OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT IS SOMETIMES USEFUL TO HIDE THINGS FROM YOURSELF. I HAVE WORKED THE MODULES AND PROJECT 1 TO COMPLETION. I GOT TANGLED UP DOING THE COMBINATORICS STUFF BECAUSE I MADE BOTH BIN AND NBIN, BUT THAT PROJECT WILL BE IN WITHIN A WEEK, AND I HAVE 500 LINES IN THE FILE THAT'S JUST WRITTEN BY ME. THIS CLASS IS COOL. I PLAN TO DO AT LEAST WHAT IT TAKES TO GET AN A OF:
