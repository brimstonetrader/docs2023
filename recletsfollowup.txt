Hello Dr. Goadrich! I have been heavily considering what I want to get out of Graduate School. I really enjoy taking part in research, and this is the most accessible path to living off of it. I am mostly applying to programs in CS Theory, Discrete Math, and a smidge of AI. I have added some schools to my list, as I've found that acceptance rates are quite low across the board, and it is better to be safe than sorry. Additionally, my family has encouraged me to apply to two gonzo reaches, that I figure my odds are very slim at, but that I am attempting. Attached is a spreadsheet with schools, deadlines, my desired degree program, and application portals. There should be links to upload recommendations to each in your Hendrix email: if this is not the case, I can resend an invitation. Thank you for your recommendation; I wish you well.

Hello Dr. Downes! I have been considering what I want to get out of Graduate School. I really enjoy taking part in research, and this is the most accessible path towards it. I am mostly applying to programs in CS Theory, Discrete Math, and a smidge of AI. I have added some schools to my list, as I've found that acceptance rates are quite low across the board, and it is better to be safe than sorry. Additionally, my family has encouraged me to apply to a couple of major reaches, that I figure my odds are very slim at, but that I am attempting. Linked below is a spreadsheet with schools, deadlines, my desired degree program, and application portals. There should be links to upload recommendations to each in your Hendrix email: if this is not the case, I can resend an invitation. Thank you for your recommendation; I wish you well.
