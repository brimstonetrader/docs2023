-- tabled for next time -- latin america check-in, or, "the pink tide"

Lula (jan 1 2023 pres of brazil) just narrowly beat out bolsonaro, cementing all six top Latin American economies as being run by leftists. This contrasts starkly with the many right-wing regimes the U.S. inflicted throughout the region, only a generation ago. I'm trying to research this so-called "pink tide", 300 to 400 word expository. I'd like to interview Shwartzkopf, yuste-alonso or whoever else in the Spanish department or beyond y'all think might have something interesting to say on the topic. I'm going in purely, blindly (that is, "not knowing a whole lot"), believing that democracy and social welfare are good and autocracy and imperialism are bad. 400-or-so word interview
