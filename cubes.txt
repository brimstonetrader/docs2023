	dimensions(x,y)
	types of available cubes(create list of shapes)
	initial cube placement(let user place some, or let a random placement happen along certain guidelines)
	(toggle) definition of group (may define multiple)
		line
			broken / unbroken

			(toggle) captures interior
			(toggle) edges are neutral
		symmetric region
			(odd duck to allow for entropy)
		polyomino(general, particular place, or controlled random)
			on creation:
				remove
				(turn action)
				immune to capture
				move is illegal
				(toggle) display polygon on side
				(toggle) symmetries		
		(toggle) subgroups are groups too
		(toggle) sanctity enforced
		(toggle) all/homo
	(toggle) pie rule

	(toggle) toroidal 2,4,2mobius,4mobius
loop turn
	(can be stacked with and, or, not)
	movement
		per type of cube
			group or cube
			choose 1:
				linear (x, range, random, mancalan, size of group)
				orthogonal(x, range, random, infinite, mancalan, size of group)
				diagonal(x, range, random, infinite, mancalan, size of group)
				hippogonal((x,y), range, random, infinite, mancalan, size of group)
				custom (spiral style)
				switching (x,y)		
			(toggle) every move must come closer to (location)
			(toggle) must remain in (location)
			(toggle) leaping legal over all/homo
			(toggle) glide till barrier

	laying
		square, intersection, boundary
			if on intersection 
				cubes on squares may not pass through enemy cubes on walls
				friendly cubes on walls
					may not be crossed
					may be crossed, but is removed, changing color of other one
		finite/infinite hand (if finite, list of cubes)		
		per type of cube (as well as random and opponent's choice)
			each turn lay down (n, range) 		
		(toggle) one per group
		(toggle) create new group
		(toggle) within (location)
		(toggle) not/within (x,y) of het/hom cube/lastlaidcube
		(toggle) where cube moved from this turn (or intermediate along path)
	transformation
		type to type (empty is a type)
			if y = Empty:
						(toggle) reintroduction of unboarded pieces (self/opponent)
			on choice at turn=(x, range)
			at location
			on (connection)
			on cohabitation (attacker type, defender type)
			on custodian(group or cube, sides)
			on pushed off board
