I have long held an interest in creative writing, and have spent the past year working as a staff writer at the Hendrix Profile (a newsletter we publish). I've written articles on our Title IX Office, transportation infrastructure in Conway, the Fall of FTX, and many other topics. In my personal time, I write fiction in the vein of Pynchon and Vonnegut. I would like to work in the field, in any sort of way. Hendrix does not carry a journalism program, but I've taken five electives throughout the English Department, and write a lot, in spite of my STEM major and minor. The organizational and logical techniques that come with math and CS, to be fair, come in handy when sketching out an argument or explanation. Writing passionately and persuasively is a skill that I love to hone, and one that I'd love to hone with you. 

I have extensive training in Math and Computer Science, and would be very able to maintain a website within an organization. I have been trained in scientific python and data visualization, and can create interesting and intuitive graphs and charts out of any spreadsheet or csv file you throw at me. I know my way around Excel, as well as the rest of the suite. While I don't have sales experience in this sense, I think the analytical aspect will come easy. Mostly, I want to work in an environment where I feel pushed, that I'm making progress that can be measured tangibly. I enjoy this aspect of both journalism and computer science, and would be happy to work as hard as I can in whatever internship you decide I'm best suited for.
