GRADING CONTRACT EVAL

Oh no! I did one contract evaluation, but I missed the one in September. I'm real sorry - for some reason I'd concluded there'd be only one for the semester. But, no, I wrote "CONTRACT EVAL 2" on the last one. I guess I thought I had done it already. This means that when I said in class that I had already done my second contract evaluation, I was technically incorrect, which the Futurama show would lead me to believe is the worst kind of incorrect. I hope this and a token can rectify that. This is what I need to do better. Well, I suppose I could be a better POGILer. I try my best, but I don't prioritize my fellow group members' learning experiences to the extent that I feel I should. That's not to say that I don't look around and and listen and try to make sure everyone's on the same page before we move on, but I think I could do a better job of all that. Also, I don't take "Reflector" enough. I am not aware of any ways other than missing an evaluation (which I am sorry for) that I am not fulfilling a contract for an A. Now that this evaluation is here, I would like to continue to contract for an A.

I feel good about the personal standard of discipline I've maintained in this class. Regardless of whether that feeling is founded or even reasonable, it feeds into itself like a positive feedback loop, and so I allow it. Back when I was particular about only doing math, because "I don't enjoy being online or playing video games, so what would I find enjoyable about coding?", a department alum that will remain anonymous had me convinced that the class was akin to Bowser: the toughest available: code on crack: beyond me. Eventually, I found that coding did not feel particularly similar to being online or playing video games, but was more akin to messing around in a cozy garage, making contraptions from wood and nails on a long weekend for <20$, or writing nonfiction. And so I enjoy the crack-code class. It has been very creative, and it has not been difficult for me to maintain enthusiasm about the course material. As an instructor, you should have made all of the assignments available at the start of the semester instead of posting them intermittently, is my advice to you.
