Project 3: Quilt
================

```{.quilt .code size=512 name=images/swirl}
let swirl = (let grate = -cos (x*20*pi)/2 + 0.5 in grate @ (20*(sin(50*sqrt(x*x + y*y)))))
in  swirl * yellow + (y+1)/2 * blue
```

In this project, you will create a language which can describe and
produce images like the one above!

Getting started
---------------

- Download the [project skeleton](quilt.zip).  This provides:

    - [`QuiltREPL.hs`](QuiltREPL.hs): a REPL, similar to the one on the calculator project
    - [`Quilt.hs`](Quilt.hs): starter code
    - [`Parsing2.hs`](../code/Parsing2.hs)
    - [`quilt.cabal`](quilt.cabal)
    - [`stack.yaml`](stack.yaml)
    - [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) (feel free to edit this file to add your name)

- While working on your project, to load it into `ghci` (e.g. in
   order to try out a function), you can use the `stack repl` command.

- To compile and run your project, you can use the command `stack run`
  (this should be typed at a terminal/shell prompt, not at a ghci
  prompt).

    - You should get a prompt where you can enter quilt expressions
      and commands.  Currently, it will only generate an image of a
      blue square.

    - Simply exit the program and rerun `stack run` every time
      you want to test changes you have made to `Quilt.hs`.

- If you like, you can also view the source for this project
  description file itself, although it is not necessary: [Quilt.lhs](Quilt.lhs).

The Quilt language: basic examples
----------------------------------

The basic Quilt language has real numbers, booleans, arithmetic
operations, `if`-expressions, names of standard colors, RGB color
expressions, and `quilt` expressions.

The name of a color by itself produces an image consisting entirely of
that color:

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/red}
red
```

Arithmetic can be done on colors, which results in their red, green,
and blue channels being operated on componentwise.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/purple}
red + blue
```

Colors can be explicitly constructed by giving a triple of values in
list notation.  Each channel should be a number between 0 and 1;
[0,0,0] represents black and [1,1,1] represents white.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/explicitcolor}
[0.2, 0.8, 0.5]
```

To make things more interesting, there are special reserved variables
`x` and `y` which can be used to refer to the position within the
image.  All the images are centered at the origin, with x and y
ranging from $-1$ to $1$.  As a simple example, we can use `if`
together with `x` and `y` to choose different colors for different
parts of the image.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/half}
if x < y then red else blue
```

We can also use `x` and `y` in more continuous ways.  For example,
this image smoothly interpolates between red and blue, using the value
of `x`.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/redblue}
(x+1)/2*red + (1-(x+1)/2)*blue
```

We can also use `x` and `y` inside a color expression, as a more
direct way to produce smoothly varying colors.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/colorxy}
[(x+1)/2, (y+1)/2, 0.5]
```

Finally, the `quilt` operator takes four images and arranges them in a
square.

```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/quilt}
quilt 0.4 yellow red (quilt green orange blue purple)
```

Notice how the number 0.4 can be used as a color, resulting in the
color `[0.4, 0.4, 0.4]` (a dark gray).

Grammar
-------

More explicitly, the basic Quilt language has the following grammar:

```
<colorlit> ::= 'red' | 'orange' | 'yellow' | ...
<num>      ::= integer or floating-point
<coord>    ::= 'x' | 'y'
<bool>     ::= 'False' | 'True'

<qexp> ::=
  | <colorlit>
  | <num>
  | <coord>
  | <bool>
  | '[' <qexp> ',' <qexp> ',' <qexp> ']'
  | 'if' <qexp> 'then' <qexp> 'else' <qexp>
  | <uop> <qexp>
  | <qexp> <bop> <qexp>
  | 'quilt' <qexp> <qexp> <qexp> <qexp>

<uop>        ::= '-' | '!'
<bop>        ::= <arith> | <comparison> | <boolean>
<arith>      ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
<comparison> ::= '<' | '>' | ...
<boolean>    ::= '&&' | '||'
```

Types
-----

Quilt has three types:

  * `Boolean` represents Boolean values,
  * `Number` represents floating-points numbers, and
  * `Color` represents a triple of floating-point numbers.

In general, an expression of type `X` represents a **function** that
assigns a value of that type to every $(x,y)$ coordinate.  For
example, an expression of type `Boolean` represents not just a single
`True` or `False`, but an assignment of `True` or `False` to every
$(x,y)$ coordinate.  For example, `x < y` has type `Boolean`, and
assigns `True` to every coordinates where $x$ is less than $y$, and
`False` to the others.

Note that a `Color` value is just a triple of arbitrary floating-point
numbers; it does not necessarily have to be a valid, visible color.
For example, `[0.2,0.3,-1]` is a "color" even though an actual visible
color must have three values between 0 and 1.

+ `<colorlit>` values have type `Color`; numeric values have type
  `Number`, as do `<coord>`s; Boolean literals have type `Bool`.
+ `if`-expressions expect a `Boolean` test, and two cases with the same
  type.
+ Literal color triples expect three `Number` values, and produce a
  `Color`.
+ Boolean operators like `!`, `&&`, *etc.* expect booleans and yield booleans.
+ Comparison operators expect two `Number` values and yield a `Boolean`;
  it does not make sense to compare colors.
+ **Arithmetic operators are overloaded** to work on either numbers or
  colors.  Doing arithmetic on colors results in the arithmetic being
  done componentwise. For example, `[0.2, 3, -1] * [6, 2, 3] =
  [1.2, 6, -3]`.
+ `quilt` is overloaded to work on *any* type.  For example, it can
  take four boolean expressions and construct a new boolean
  expression; or four numeric expressions to construct a numeric
  expression, and so on.

There is one final twist: numbers are a *subtype* of colors, that is,
a numeric value can be used anywhere that a color is expected.  (As we
have seen, the number $n$ will be interpreted as the color $[n,n,n]$.)
This has some interesting implications.  For example:

+ Arithmetic operators do not literally require two arguments of the
  same type.  One can be a number and the other a color, in which case
  the number will be automatically treated like a color (for example,
  `0.1 + [0.2, 0.3, 0.5] = [0.3, 0.4, 0.6]`).  If the two arguments to
  an arithmetic operator are both `Number`, then the result is still a
  `Number`; but if either argument is a `Color`, then the result will be a
  `Color`.

+ The two branches of an `if` do not have to be the same if one is a
  `Number` and one a `Color`. This works similarly to arithmetic
  operators.

+ `quilt` expects four expressions of the same type---four `Boolean`,
  four `Number`, or four `Color`.  But since numbers can be used as colors,
  it should be possible to give `quilt` any combination of numbers and colors.
  If `quilt` is given four booleans, the whole expression has type `Boolean`;
  if given four numbers, the whole expression has type `Number`; if given
  a mixture of numbers and colors, the whole expression has type `Color`.

Some hints for dealing with subtyping in your type checker:

+ You may find it helpful to write a function like `isSubtype :: Type -> Type -> Bool`.
  Note that every type is a subtype of itself.

+ Try to separate type inference involving subtyping into two phases: first,
  recursively infer the types of subexpressions; second, make sure their types are
  appropriately compatible, and if so compute an appropriate output type.
  You will probably want one or more helper functions to do this.

Semantics
---------

The x and y coordinates for an image produced by the Quilt language
will both vary from -1 to 1, with the origin (0,0) in the center of
the image.

*Everything* in the quilt language (booleans, numbers, colors) can
vary continuously over 2D space.  For example, consider the expression
`x < y`: `x` and `y` both have type `Number`, so `x < y` has type
`Boolean`.  However, semantically it does not represent just a single
boolean, but rather a *function* of type `Double -> Double -> Bool`
which attaches a boolean value to every point in 2D space (according
to whether the `x`-coordinate at that point is less than the
`y`-coordinate).  If you look again at other examples above, you will
see more examples of numbers and colors varying over space.

This means your interpreter should always produce something of the
form `(Double -> Double -> ...)`.  One could have it produce a `Double
-> Double -> Value`, and define a new type `Value` which can be either
a boolean, a number, or a color.  However, since Quilt expressions
will be typechecked, you can use the same trick we have used before:
just represent everything (booleans, numbers, and colors) as a
`Color`, that is, a list of `Double` values.  So your interpreter will
always output a `QuiltFun`, that is, a `Double -> Double -> Color`.  A
boolean can be represented by, say, `[0]` or `[1]`; a number `n`
should be represented by the list `[n,n,n]`.  If you have a `[Double]`
but need a boolean or a number, just get the first element of the
list.  This way, your interpreter does not actually have to worry
about issues of subtyping or conversion, and it does not need to do
any pattern-matching to figure out what kind of value it has.

What to turn in
---------------

* Of course you should turn in `Quilt.hs`.  Be sure it has comments
  explaining the different pieces of your implementation, as appropriate.

* You must also turn in a file called `README.txt`.  This file should
  contain:

    - Your name
    - A description of your implementation of Quilt and any extensions
      you added (see below)
    - A list of example Quilt expressions which show off the features
      of your language

* Turn in `QuiltREPL.hs` only if you made any modifications to it.  If
  you did not modify it at all, you do not need to turn it in.

Level 1
-------

For Level 1 credit, get the Quilt language as described above working
in the context of the provided REPL.  The user enters an expression,
and is shown a syntax error, a type error, or gets an image.

Level 2
-------

To complete this project to Level 2, in addition to the requirements
for Level 1:

- Make sure your error messages are pleasant to read (*e.g.* using
  some sort of pretty-printing as appropriate) and informative.  For
  example, here is an example interactive session with my
  implementation:

    ```
    > 3 + True
    Expressions 3 and True have incompatible types (number and boolean).
    > [[5, 6, (8*9)+2], 0, 1]
    Type mismatch: expression [5, 6, 8 * 9 + 2] was expected to be a number, but is actually a color.
    > 3 + if
    (line 1, column 7):
    unexpected end of input
    expecting end of "if", "(", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", ...
    > red + blue
    256x256 -> quilt.png
    ```

    Your project *doesn't* need to look the same or have the same
    error messages as mine; I provide it simply for inspiration.

- Ensure that your code uses [good Haskell style](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide).

- Make sure your code is simplified as much as possible, for example,
  without redundant pattern-matching.

- Turn on `{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wall #-}` and make sure your code generates no warnings.

- Write informative, grammatically correct comments explaining your
   code, its operation, and any choices you made along with the
   reasons for those choices.

- Complete *at least one* extension (see the list of suggested
  extensions below; or come up with your own).

Level 3
-------

To complete this project to Level 3, in addition to the requirements
for Level 2, you must complete *at least three* extensions, at least
one of which is *not* in the list below.  Feel free to consult with me
if you are unsure whether your idea for an extension is feasible or
substantive enough.

Suggested extensions
--------------------

+ Add more arithmetic functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `floor`,
  `ceil`, `round`, `sqrt`, `abs`, more operators like `%` and `^`, and so
  on. (Hint: parse functions like `sin` as prefix operators with high
  precedence in the expression parser.) (Hint: if you add trig
  functions, it's nice to also add the constant `pi`.)

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/bars}
    (-cos(8*pi*x)/2 + 0.5) * green
    ```

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/rings}
    -cos(50*sqrt(x*x + y*y))/4 + -cos(50*(sqrt((x-0.2)*(x-0.2) + y*y)))/4 + 0.5
    ```

+ Add variables and `let`-expressions.  This extension has high bang for the buck, since it allows you to concisely describe much more complicated images by giving subpieces names and then being able to repeat them.

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/let1}
    let circ = 1-(x*x + y*y) in quilt [circ,0,0] [0,circ,0] [0,0,circ] circ
    ```

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/let2}
    let checks  = quilt black white white black in
    let checks2 = quilt checks checks checks black in
    let checks3 = quilt checks2 checks2 checks2 black in
    let checks4 = quilt checks3 checks3 checks3 black in
    let checks5 = quilt checks4 checks4 checks4 black in
    checks5
    ```

+ Add operators to do geometric transformations like rotation,
  translation, and scaling. For example, you might add binary
  operators like
    - `rot` or `@`: rotation by an angle
    - `tx`: translate in the x direction
    - `ty`: translate in the y direction
    - `scale`: scale by a given factor
    - `sx`: scale in the x direction
    - `sy`: scale in the y direction

    Each of these binary operators takes an arbitrary type `t` as
    its first argument and a number as its second argument, and produces
    a result of type `t`.

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/transform}
    let circ = 1-(x*x + y*y) in
      ((circ*red) sx 0.6 tx 0.5)
      + ((circ*green) sy 1.1 ty 0.2)
      + ((circ*blue) scale 0.7 tx (-0.4))
    ```

    Really weird and cool things happen when you realize
    that you can transform by a "number" which actually varies over
    the plane! For example, here I make a `grate` consisting of
    vertical bars, and then apply a rotation of `40*(0.5-(x*x + y*y))`
    degrees at location `(x,y)`:

    ```{.quilt .code size=256 name=images/swirl1}
    let grate = -cos (x*20*pi)/2 + 0.5 in grate @ (40*(0.5-(x*x + y*y)))
    ```

    I used a similar principle in constructing the example at the very
    top of this page.  Note my rotations are specified in *degrees*, so
    the interpreter has to convert them to radians before giving them as
    arguments to `sin` and `cos`.  You are free to use degrees, radians,
    fractions of a circle, or whatever other units you wish.

+ Add a time dimension in order to create animations.  For example,
  you can add another special variable `t` representing time, and
  change your interpreter so it now returns a function that expects
  *three* `Double` arguments (time, x, and y).  The variable `t`
  allows you to describe arbitrary images that change over time.  For
  example,
  ```
  (1-t) * blue + t * red
  ```
  might describe an animation which smoothly shifts from blue to red
  over the course of 1 second.

    If you want to do this extension, I can provide you with some
    Haskell code to turn such functions into animated GIF images.

+ Add a fourth component to your colors in order to specify an alpha,
  i.e. transparency channel.  Most likely, however, you will want to
  retain the ability to describe normal, opaque colors as well, so you
  will want a bit of subtyping magic, *e.g.* perhaps `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`
  is automatically treated as if it were `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0]`.

+ Add complex numbers.  For example, you can add a special constant
  `i` as well as a variable `z` which has the value `x + i*y`.  This
  extension is interesting from a typing point of view: probably you
  would want a new type for complex numbers, with real numbers as a
  subtype.  Some functions such as `abs` and the arithmetic operators
  work on both real and complex numbers; but some things like
  comparisons can only be done on reals, and colors can only be
  created from real numbers.

    Mumble mumble [Möbius transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation) something something mumble?

+ Once you have added `let`-expressions and geometric scaling, you
  could try making `let`-expressions recursive (*i.e.* `let x = q1 in
  q2` binds `x` in `q1` as well as `q2`), in order to be able to
  produce fractal images.  This can easily lead to infinite recursion,
  so you will have to add something to your interpreter to keep track
  of the current scaling factor, so it can cut off the recursion when
  the scaling factor gets sufficiently small (*i.e.* when further
  recursion would produce details smaller than one pixel).

+ Add functions and function types.  This is nontrivial but results in
  a much more expressive language.  For example, instead of just
  giving individual images a name, you can give names to
  common *operations* on images and apply them multiple times.
