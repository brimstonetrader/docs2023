There is a genocide occuring right now, in 2023. 
I think that the number of people here are not reflective of the horrors that are actually happening. As a Jew, I was raised to believe that "holocaust" means "never again," and that should mean never again for any group of people. A common question that we ask ourselves is 'what would you do in the event of a holocaust? What would your neighbors do?' Right now, we're sort of asking the same question, and it seems that Arkansas, and America in general, isn't showing as much solidarity as we could be, considering that currently a child dies in Palestine roughly every nine minutes."
