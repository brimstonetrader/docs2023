55.25                   TOTAL OUT-OF-CLASS HOURS SPENT WORKING ON FINAL PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Complete final project will
->  demonstrate participation in all SME and group meetings
->  include a complete design document, with appropriate revisions throughout the project
->  develop a viable first prototype with appropriate aesthetics and at least one scene
->  revise into a second prototype with multiple levels, and the start/credit/help scenes
->  facilitate playtesting and report on the results and future timeline for completion
->  iterate a final prototype that is polished and published on itch.io
->  present your prototype and development process to your SME and local educators
->  contain significant and regular contributions on Github
->  include an hours log with 30+ hours of work documented
