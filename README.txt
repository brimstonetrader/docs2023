-- QUILT

-- A Quilt is a 256x256 pixel png image. They can be described by their rgb values, like [r, g, b], or single double values (g = [g, g, g], a full greyscale). One can do arithmetic on component values or entire quilts. As components, one may use x and y, the coordinates of the given pixel on a grid from (-1,-1) to (1,1). One can do if x then q1 else q2 statements, where x :: Double, and is rounded up or down to the nearer of 0 and 1, i.e., false and true. The quilt q1 q2 q3 q4 operator lets one tile the plane with four quilts.
 
For Level 3, I've added some extra functions

-- import math        (trig, mod, raise, pi, e, abs, ceil, floor, round)
-- import geom        (rot, dim [compresses a lot of geometric transformations into one command. input minx, maxx, miny, maxy, to make it bigger or move your viewing window around. you can't go too far, something like -10 10 -10 10 is too much for it.].
-- import lvl3        (
magnitude = m
phase = p
liner = "~ [x1] [x2] [y1] [y2]", draws a line from one coordinate to another
tiler (input "\[t\][qlit]", and your pixels will be emsmallened from 256*256 to t*t)
circle, square, and triangle [radius] [x1] [x2] do what you'd expect. )
     
-- tried and failed: randomness/boolean superposition, n-gons with roots of unity                






But I’m A Cheerleader (1999) is a technicolor romp through surreal pray-away-the-gay camp “True Directions,” led by gruff femdom superintendent Mary Brown and her himbo son Rock. RuPaul, who plays a repressed male guidance counselor, at one point consoles the protagonist, Megan (a career best Natasha Lyonne), by informing her that “I myself was once a gay.” The film strikes a steady balance, respecting the subjects (a likable, diverse cadre of gay kids) while maintaining a joyful, irreverent tone throughout. The soundtrack is excellent alt-rock, all from gay women. The lighting and cinematography are disorienting, but in an intentional way that forces the viewer to relate to Megan within her little psychedelic odyssey. The major arc is a love story, a devastatingly sappy one that might spark a cop to yearn or a fed to pause, some primo lesbo content that’ll shake a poem loose from your mangled over-mediated cranium is what i’m getting at. Check hulu, Apple TV, or fmovies.wtf for the greatest LGBT contribution to film, except of course for Moonlight (2017), the greatest movie of all time. If you haven’t already been ripped to shreds by that one, go buzz off and die. Bitcoin!
