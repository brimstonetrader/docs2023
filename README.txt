But I’m A Cheerleader (1999) is a technicolor romp through surreal pray-away-the-gay camp “True Directions,” led by gruff femdom superintendent Mary Brown and her himbo son Rock. RuPaul, who plays a repressed male guidance counselor, at one point consoles the protagonist, Megan (a career best Natasha Lyonne), by informing her that “I myself was once a gay.” The film strikes a steady balance, respecting the subjects (a likable, diverse cadre of gay kids) while maintaining a joyful, irreverent tone throughout. The soundtrack is excellent alt-rock, all from gay women. The lighting and cinematography are disorienting, but in an intentional way that forces the viewer to relate to Megan within her little psychedelic odyssey. The major arc is a love story, a devastatingly sappy one that might spark a cop to yearn or a fed to pause, some primo lesbo content that’ll shake a poem loose from your mangled over-mediated cranium is what i’m getting at. Check hulu, Apple TV, or fmovies.wtf for the greatest LGBT contribution to film, except of course for Moonlight (2017), the greatest movie of all time. If you haven’t already been ripped to shreds by that one, go buzz off and die. Bitcoin!
