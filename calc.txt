Project 2: Calculator
=====================

For this project, you will implement the guts of a (fancy) calculator.
I have provided you with a simple read-eval-print interface (in
[CalcREPL.hs](CalcREPL.hs)) that lets the user type in expressions to
be evaluated.  You will ultimately provide a function of type `String
-> String` which accepts the user's input and produces a response.  Of
course, your `String -> String` function should be decomposed into
multiple phases, just like all of the language implementations we have
been considering (such as parsing, pretty-printing, interpreting, and
so on).  This project intentionally gives you much less guidance than
the first project in terms of what specific data types and functions
you should write, and how to decompose your solution.  However, you
can of course use the modules we have done as templates to help guide
you.

Getting started
---------------

- Download the [provided zip file](calc.zip), which should contain several
  files including [`CalcREPL.hs`](CalcREPL.hs),
  [`Calc.lhs`](Calc.lhs), [`Parsing2.hs`](Parsing2.hs), and a
  few configuration files such as `calc.cabal` and `stack.yaml`.

- Extract the contents of the zip file.

- If you do not have Haskell working on your computer you can use
  `replit.com` to complete this project. Simply upload all the
  provided files to a new `replit.com` project.

- While working on your calculator, to load it into `ghci` (e.g. in
   order to try out a function), you can use the `stack repl` command.

- To compile and run your calculator, you can use the command `stack run`
  (this should be typed at a terminal/shell prompt, not at a ghci
  prompt).

      cd Downloads/360/calc
      stack repl
      :l Calc

    - You should get a calculator prompt where you can enter expressions (though
      it will not do anything yet).

    - Simply exit the calculator and rerun `stack run` every time
      you want to test changes you have made to `Calc.lhs`.

Level 1
-------

Your calculator must support the following features:

- Floating-point numbers (represented as `Double` values)
- Standard arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^`
  as well as prefix negation
- Display appropriate error messages to the user instead of crashing
- Display appropriate startup and `:help` messages which
  explain/illustrate the features of the calculator.

For example, a sample interaction with your calculator might look like
this:

    > 2+3
    5
    > (((3*5)   -   9)  + -8.3)
    -2.3000000000000007
    > 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2
    65536.0
    > (3+3)*3
    18.0
    > 3+
    (line 1, column 3):
    unexpected end of input
    expecting end of "+", number, or "("

Your calculator must never crash with a runtime error or
pattern-match failure.

Get started by editing the starter code below and adding to it as
appropriate!

General notes and hints
-----------------------

+ You can use the `reserved` token parser to parse things like
  function names, names of constants or units, *etc.*
+ You can use the `naturalOrFloat` token parser to parse literal
  values that can either be an integer or a floating-point value. Note
  it does not handle negatives; that should be taken care of
  automatically by your prefix negation operator.
+ You can use `fromIntegral` to convert from `Integer` to `Double`.
+ You should use the `parse` function to run your parser.  If it
  returns an error wrapped in a `Left` constructor, you can simply
  call `show` on the resulting error to turn it into a `String`
  appropriate for displaying to the calculator user.
+ The `parseSome` function can be used as before for experimenting
  with parsers in GHCi.
+ Exponentiation for `Double` values in Haskell is done with the
  `(**)` operator.  (The `(^)` operator is only for integers.)

be a good way to concisely show off the different features of your

Level 2
-------

To complete this project to Level 2, in addition to the requirements
for Level 1:

- Re-display a nicely formatted version of the user's input as
  confirmation of each computation.  For example, a sample interaction
  with your calculator might now look like this:

    ```
    > 2+3
    2.0 + 3.0
      = 5.0
    > (((3*5)  -   9)  + -8.3)
    3.0 * 5.0 - 9.0 + -8.3
      = -2.3000000000000007
    > 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2
    2.0 ^ 2.0 ^ 2.0 ^ 2.0
      = 65536.0
    > (3+3)*3
    (3.0 + 3.0) * 3.0
      = 18.0
    ```

- Ensure that your code uses [good Haskell style](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide).

- Make sure your code is simplified as much as possible, for example,
  without redundant pattern-matching.

- Turn on `{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wall #-}` and make sure your code generates no warnings.

- Write informative, grammatically correct comments explaining your
   code, its operation, and any choices you made along with the
   reasons for those choices.

Level 3
-------

To complete this project to Level 3, in addition to the requirements
for Level 2, you must complete *at least two* extensions.  You may
pick from the following list of suggested extensions (ordered roughly
from easier to harder), or propose your own.

1. Add support for the constants $\pi$ and $e$, along with at least
   five functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, log, floor, ceiling,
   round, square root, or absolute value.  For example, a sample
   interaction might look like this:

    ```
    > sin(pi/6)
    sin(π / 6.0)
      = 0.49999999999999994
    > cos(tan(log(abs(-2))))
    cos(tan(log(abs(-2.0))))
      = 0.6744026976311414
    > ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^2 - 1
    ((1.0 + sqrt(5.0)) / 2.0) ^ 2.0 - 1.0
      = 1.618033988749895
    ```

e, pi, i, phi, c, sin, cos, tan, log, fractional exponents, floor, ceiling, |-x| = x, sum and product, Fib(a,b)


5. You should also feel free to propose your own extensions; just be
   sure to run them by me to make sure you choose something with an
   appropriate level of difficulty.
