HEY YORGO YOU WEBSITE SAY YOU DO COMBIINATORICS WITH KIDS I SUBMIT MYSELF

i'm doing a summer thing w goad and tryna go hard on the cs thesis, but fall/spring semester or that following summer i'd be down to put some effort toward any one of these. 


INTRIGUED:

PROJECTS:
	-Strategies for nim-like games with extra losing conditions
		brent this one is gas. i'd be interested in going deep. already so sold. also i like these win position graphs and now i'm thinking of clobber and domineering. could be a blast, similar to my planned CS thesis, and an easy way to fill a semester.
		
	-formally verified, functional implementation of Sawada’s algorithm.
		listen brent. i'm trying to take functional in the spring. I'm outta here by the end of next summer, but I'd be down to try for this one right before. I remember the necklace problem! Suthy spent a day or so on it. might be lit. :\


hey brent i could take an inependent study fall semester or spring really but if i did it in spring i'd prob drop functional to do it instead of ai so brent-mon stake your claim. idgaf really, ai and fp seem about the same level of interesting to me (that is to say, pretty interesting)

IND.STUDY:
	CATEGORY,AUTOMATON THEORY / THEORETICAL COMPUTING
	RECREATIONAL MATHEMATICS / COMBINATORIC GAME THEORY


listen brent it's all hyper-discrete stuff. i'd love to have a class period where we straight up running the numbers. captain!


my current sched for next year

alg     cso
ss      ch
af  	wl

ai (is) fp 

an independent study would replace something in the bottom of either, those are electives. i'll hear out an objection to any elective.
