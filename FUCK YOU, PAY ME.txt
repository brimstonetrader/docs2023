My good friend Shaunell had an article published in the Profile two issues back which pointed out some uncomfortable continuities in campus organizations, in response to which this publication recieved much feedback. I helped her with some stuff for it, and a slight inaccuraccy was noted, and I can tell you precisely what caused it: an out of date spreadsheet.
