SECT. 1.1: INSPIRATION

Why does anybody study mathematics? Are algorithms essentially philanthropic, enmeshed structures beyond us, or fickle, entropic living beings? Why am I alive?

...

To acquire dollars. Let's go with that.

Sudoku was invented by Howard Garns, a modest architect from Indiana
who died a decade before anyone attached his name to it. His coworkers, in
interviews conducted after his death, noted that he would create obtuse number
crosswords based on nines on the company’s drawing boards, seemingly as a
game. They only caught brief glimpses of it; he usually tried to hide it from
people. He sent some in to a local magazine anonymously, Dell Pencil Puzzles
and Word Games, but sought neither credit nor profit in his lifetime[1].

The puzzle became popular in Japan, rechristened “Sudoku”, by the publisher Nikoli, 
which publishes many such pen-and-paper logic games. This was the first time the 
game turned a profit. They heard about it from Dell, under the name “Number Place”. 
You could safely find Sudoku throughout much of Japan by the late 1980s, but it 
didn’t take root in the rest of the world until the 21st century, when Wayne Gould, 
a retired judge from New Zealand, spent six years on an algorithm that generated them,
and started offering unique puzzles to newspapers across the world for free, with
solutions hosted at his website. His Sudoku books became very popular, selling
like hotcakes to an enthusiastic public. He was named one of ”The World’s Most
Influential People” by TIME in 2006[2].
