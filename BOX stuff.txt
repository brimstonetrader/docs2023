Mona

The narrator. She technically had the initial idea, and has stuck around as "CEO". She's got Damon, Damon's Dad, Stephen, D, bread, William, Sadie, Alan, and 629-16-4529 bugged, and is very willing to lie, and as such can describe scenes in rooms she is not in and so forth. She did this to her former boyfriend, is why none of that squad wants to hang out, and Stephen takes it willingly once Damon starts telling him things he's not telling her. She's writing this on a tumblr-type blog she has set to private up until near the end. She is witty.
