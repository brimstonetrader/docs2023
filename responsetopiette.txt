That's alright, hopefully my card games can help with future work on ludemes.

Dr. Piette, 

I hope that this email finds you well. Over the summer I found success in rendering three card 
games in Ludii, as well as a few abstracts, which I posted to the Forum under the name 
brimstonetrader. With these, I experimented with available AIs, and successfully avoided 
cheating, but found that they were not very effective in these games when I altered their 
contexts to remove AI access to hidden data. A short write-up summarizing my findings is 
available at this link: https://brimstonetrader.github.io/blog/Hiding_Information_From_The_AIs.pdf . 

For my Senior Capstone, I have decided to continue to work on Ludii. My major goal is to 
implement an AI that performs well and "honestly" in games with hidden information with the 
LudiiExampleAI repository. I plan to use determinization, letting each game tree search assume 
many possible contexts for games of hidden information. I'm interested both in its performance in 
card games, and puzzles in puzzles with hidden information like Minesweeper. Do you or Dr. 
Soemers know of any prior work within Ludii toward this?
