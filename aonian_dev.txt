THE AESTIVATORS

A non-descript small desert town gets overrun by a pack of human ourobouri who can go REALLY fucking fast. The protagonist is a douchey, lazy stoner who gets kicked out of a woman's house because he refuses to do his own dishes, ultimately walking along the highway until the carbon in his body is centrifugally extracted and converted to petroleum.

THE LEGITIMATE PAREDOLIAC

A guy who sees eyes everywhere he turns finds and confronts the being.

MYCCHUWELL'S LAMENT (OR, THE TABLET)

An Irish boy in the year 1000 is exploring his local woods, paying caution to heed his sister Fyello's'pith's advice not to invite loose spirits into his mind. He finds a tablet that displays whatever words will convince the reader to continue to read. The tablet eventually consumes the town crier, Jon, and Mycchuwell, slumbering for a thousand years.

THE DRIVER

A harried, Filipino Doordasher is hustling and bustling at 5:45 PM on a Tuesday. His phone dies, meaning he cannot take any new orders, and he debases himself in attempting to borrow one from the covid-brained recluses along the local apartment buildings.
